0,ap8rk6,False,Serious,469,I'm dying in two months.,ApplyingToCollege,"Hey people. 

So I made a post a while ago, about how I discovered cysts in my lungs that were life threatening. Two days ago, I was told that the disease has spread, making transplant inviable. I'm very light on the details, because really, I just don't wanna know about it too much about it myself. I consulated one of the best diagnosticians in my country. It is what it is, no point knowing what to google to find reports and probabilities, ya know? 

So yeah. I've graduated from maybe dying to surely dying.

So one of the things on my to do list is to thank as many people as possible for making life a little better. All of you are number 46 to be thanked. So thank you for the laughs, the celebrations, the kindness, the ""st anford""s, the chance mes. The last two years, I've visited this sub everyday. So I know all of you are gonna own college and life. Go get that bread.

I'm gonna get off Reddit now and try to do everything I can while lugging an oxygenator around. Gonna try to keep smiling and celebrating life till the end. It was wonderful knowing you all.

1,eqriom,False,Cursed Post,1151,I tried to kiss my interviewer! Are my chances ruined?,ApplyingToCollege,"I (17 m) had my Yale interview today. The interviewer (25 f) was smoking hot, and we really hit it off. She very clearly liked me and seemed to be giving me “the look” left right and center. I honestly lost count of the amount of times she laughed at things that I said and she seemed to genuinely enjoy talking to me. We ended up chatting for nearly 3 hours, and most of our conversation wasn’t even remotely about Yale—just random things about ourselves. Towards the end of the interview, I had a strange urge to go in for a kiss. It’s as though I completely forgot that this was an interview for college, and my desires got the best of me. I guess I completely misread the situation too, as she immediately shouted “what are you doing?” as I was about to go in for it. I instantly apologized and we kind of ended things awkwardly then and there. I am really stressed out now about the repercussions of this; I put a lot of work into my Yale application and it would really suck if it gets fucked because of this. Am I screwed?

TL;DR: Tried to kiss my Yale interviewer at the end of our conversation. I massively fucked up.

Edit: I just emailed my interviewer and both thanked her for the conversation and apologized again profusely. Not sure if there’s anything else I can do at this point. ☹️

Edit 2: The fact that people think it’s a shitpost is only making me realize more and more just how much I’ve fucked up... 

Edit 3: Damn, well this blew up. The interviewer just responded to me and said she won’t hold it against me in her report and that she really appreciated my email. She also gave me several compliments in her response and said things that she really didn't have to--this convinces me that she genuinely has no intentions to ruin my application. I’ll be sure to provide an update on this when I receive my decision. Also, I realize that I kind of came across as a “sexual predator” in this post but I assure you that I am nothing of the sort. A dumbass? Yes. Predator? Absolutely the fuck not. I am fully cognizant of the stupidity of my actions but please believe me when I say that they were incited by nothing other than my misconception that the interviewer was attracted to me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/eqriom/i_tried_to_kiss_my_interviewer_are_my_chances/,10507,Honestly if I were you I would apologize again through email and ask to set up another meeting strictly based on yale. I would add in your story of how hard you worked and that you would really appreciate another chance to show your interest and love for YALE. ,2020-01-19 04:03:14
2,62bgi8,False,Quality Meme,775,My theory: Stanford doesn't exist. Let me explain why.,ApplyingToCollege,"As we draw to the close of the college admissions process, thousands of students are waiting with drawn breath for Friday, when Stanford University will release their decisions. I was one of these students, until I stumbled upon revelations that have shaken me to the core and caused me to realize the true nature of Stanford. I share this as a warning, with the hope that one day the terrible truth will come to light: Stanford isn’t real.

First, we should make some observations. Stanford, or “Stanford” as I will refer to it occasionally, has one of the most expensive application fees in the country. This will be important later. Second, Stanford is considered one of the most prestigious colleges in the country and has an exceptionally low acceptance rate. It has alumni with a wide range of accomplishments and talents, and is generally listed as one of the world’s best places to study.

Now despite all this, let me ask, have you ever really seen anyone from “Stanford”? Have you ever met someone who recently attended the college? Sure people say they get in and go, but then what? Nothing, never to be seen again. Take a look at their website: the campus looks good right? But where are all the people? 

Now, here’s the explanation. Stanford does not exist. The campus, although obviously real, is a mere prop akin to a movie setting. They can accomplish this by rejecting every applicant, and pocketing their application fee in order to keep the “campus” looking good. When you apply to “Stanford”, you are not applying to a school but rather paying a shadowy shell company close to a hundred dollars. The interviewers? All paid actors. The pictures? All fake. There is no “Stanford”, but rather a fake campus and a network of lies.

Obviously, you probably think this is complete nonsense. “What about my friend?” you ask. “He’s a freshman at Stanford right now!” But tell me, when was the last time you saw him? “Oh he got an internship over the summer!” You sure? Perhaps he was paid off with some excess funds to “attend” so-called “Stanford”.

Finally, the “alumni”. Let me ask you a hypothetical question. Imagine you, through hard work and some luck, rose to the top of the corporate ladder and became a CEO. All your peers attended Ivies and similar institutions, while you didn’t attend college. It’d make you feel pretty small, right? But what if you were approached by someone from “Stanford” saying they could register you as an official alumni for a simple one-time payment? I don’t know about you, but I’d take the deal. And so would many others, leading to a self-fulfilling cycle where people become “alumni” in order to increase their social status, therefore making Stanford seem more prestigious and attractive. 

What we see as one of the most competitive and selective schools in the world is merely one giant illusion to keep the world’s greatest minds at bay, one $90 application fee at a time. Stay woke my friends, and stay safe.

3,9vw5qw,False,Interviews,823,I got roasted in my stanford interview yesterday.,ApplyingToCollege,"TL;DR at bottom. 


[UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/a46gxi/that_stanford_interview/?st=JPESTVPD&sh=96d699ce) 

Yesterday, I had my stanford interview. 

I arrived ahead of time and was just taking notes in my notebook, seems a small detail but it’ll be used later on. 

When he came, I shook hands and he insisted we sat outside. It was freezing cold, but I obliged nonetheless. He asked quite naturally to just introduce myself and I did... but he just interrupted me and went “sorry, I didn’t catch you. I just saw a beautiful girl. Could you repeat?”. I kinda got an odd feeling from the off with this. 

He asked me about what I do in IB, and I did so and explained my extended essay to him. He then proceeded to critically question it with various complex issues with the experiment I did for it (it was in physics, and he has a PhD in electrical engineering). He asked for the equation I derived, and obviously I can’t remember so I told him it was a long formula but I can’t quite remember. He responded by essentially telling me my experiment is quite simplistic, and it can’t be that long and complex. Then flexed his thesis that derived an 11th order formula. 
For reference, my extended essay was predicted an A. 

He asked about my econ coursework for the IB as well, and we had a short debate about monetary policy of the Fed. However, when explaining my opinions to him using simple economic concepts, he simply told me I don’t make sense. 

This was about 10mins in. 

He then proceeded to tell me “you spend your whole life studying. You won’t succeed at Stanford, you will struggle massively.”

He hadn’t asked once about what I do outside of school or ANYTHING. Nor had he seen my resume or common app beforehand. Zilch. I am convinced in hindsight he made such a comment simply because I was so into our academic discussions as an Asian. I’m convinced it was racial stereotyping. 

I refuted that claim, naturally. 
I explained all the things I do and he decimated each and every one. 

I run a funny podcast with friends for enjoyment. He ripped into it as “it does not have a purpose” despite me explaining we do it for the enjoyment and entertainment of content creation. 

I explained the two international honours I’ve received. One of them was a 3rd place. He asked me why I didn’t win, and when I gave my answer, he asked what the first place team’s project was. He told me “that’s actually innovative, all you’ve done is manipulate a few numbers. “. 
I explained my next one, and he said “I’m not interested in things you’ve done for competitions”.  

He asked me why stanford. I give a whole host of reasons ranging from the culture and how I clicked with students when I visited, all the way to specific societies and research groups that sound interesting to me. He told me “that’s not quite good enough. You can find that entrepreneurial culture in any university.”  He asked where I’m applying other than Stanford, then told me “you don’t make sense. these universities don’t have any entrepreneurial culture at all”. 

The colleges I named? Harvard, Princeton, Cornell, USC, NYU (am applying to more but didn’t want to rattle off a list of 10). He also insulted USC and NYU saying they’re simply “party schools with average academics”. 

Then he asked me what my “thing” is. I asked him to clarify what he meant, and he said “everyone has something they’re amazing or world class at such as sport, drama or music. What about you?”  

Now I’m sorry I’m not an Olympic athlete, a talented actor or a world class musician. I can’t help that. I do what I do and have excelled at what I enjoy- and I enjoy a few areas. He called me “uninteresting” and told me “you will blend in with the 50,000 applicants, you’re not differentiated. “

He asked me about what I want to do when I’m older. I told him I want to start a company.  He responded “there’s no evidence you can do this. You have no evidence. You’re 17,18, why haven’t you built a successful company already?” 

I have family responsibilities and don’t even know which area I love most to start a company in. What does he expect from me?
He then told me “real passion and evidence” is like this example of a girl who did debating since she was 9. 

He then asked about what drives me. I open up about what drives me... and he completely shut me down and told me it’s “not really a motivation”.

He questioned me on if I drink alcohol. Obviously I say no even though I do.... then he criticises me and says it’s “ridiculous that You follow your parents wishes even when they’re  not around”. Eventually I break my guard and say I have the odd beer with friends. 

Then, he wrapped up the interview by telling me “I know what I’m saying is probably making your mind race at 100mph behind that superficial smile of yours but you have to drop that. “ in a serious tone. 
He told me I “don’t have a story, narrative or drive in life” and to go and “find them and email it” to him. 

He said he would email me what he’s going to report to stanford and “not to be disheartened by it”. 

Then, as he’s leaving he tells me “take your little notebook, reflect and sit there and take some notes on what I’ve said. “

As I said, in hindsight his comment about me spending my life studying was imo racially driven. In hindsight, I should’ve respectfully terminated the interview there and then. 
He had no right to make such a comment. 

I should’ve been self aware of the situation, instead I was taken aback by his comment and too involved.

Advice: if an interview is going badly, be self aware. Don’t take shit, even if you think your future is in their hands - because it really isn’t. 

Honestly I’d rather have taken the L there and then from Stanford (most likely happening anyway) than sit through and defend myself against a constant unfair, unwarranted bombardment of criticism. The tone he took with me was condescending at best. I was nothing but polite and sincere. Luckily, I’m not too upset by this. Just pissed off. If it were someone sensitive, with the way he spoke, they could well have been in tears. 

TL;DR: Interviewer was a huge asshole and constantly criticised me. I believe he stereotyped the fact I’m Asian  when he told me I “spend my life studying” and thus will “struggle at Stanford” without knowing anything about me. Advice: don’t take shit from interviewers. I should’ve walked out there and then. 

EDIT: This lasted 2 hours. 

EDIT: Thank you to everyone. I appreciate the support and amazing advice - even those that have been downvoted.

EDIT: I am Male. 

EDIT: There will be an update post after decisions are released by December 15.

5,9uexgd,False,Rant,511,FUCK COLLEGE BOARD,ApplyingToCollege,"This doesn't affect us seniors (thank god) but starting next year they're gonna require students to register for AP tests in the fall. For most people, if they get into an early school, they will only take the tests that that school accepts for credit, but I guess the College Board wanted to put a stop to that. They're using the excuse that it's so ""students can commit to CoLLeGe-LeVeL wOrK early in the school year"", but I'm pretty sure we all know the real rea$on

Edit: Here's a link https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/about-ap/news-changes/ap-2019/why-are-we-making-changes

Edit 2: While we're at it, just a reminder that the College Board's CEO made $1.3M in 2009, and nineteen of its executives make more than $300,000 a year. [Here's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Board#Criticism) some other fun stuff about how great the nOt-FoR-pRoFiT College Board is",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/9uexgd/fuck_college_board/,7877,"It is unfortunate, but it is not really a surprise. My mother and I had a hunch this would happen, and it seems like it is. The shift from regular schooling to having students take college level classes has been happening for awhile. Sure, it's more pressure and money to take the exam, but it is just how education is evolving. There are more things a student has to do to get ahead of the game, and now the College Board is capitalizing on that in order to make them mandated instead of optional for, as you said, money reasons. I am more curious of what more students will have to do in later years in order to stand out. Probably will be what I am doing: enrolling into community college programs during the school year or summer break to get an associates degree early.

[EDIT]
This is really getting downvoted? Honestly guys, this is hardly a big deal. It ain't a lot of money like /u/1millionbuckss said, the only real issue is what you will do after this. Accept it, education is changing and you just have to roll with the punches. I know everyone has been wanting to shit on college board lately from the SAT to this, but there is just nothing you can do. Downvoting me will not make this disappear, and cursing them out gets you no where either. ",2018-11-05 16:23:23
6,e20pcf,False,Quality Meme,252,The worst essays you can write,ApplyingToCollege,"**The ""metaphor"" essay**

If you really think about it, life is exactly like a burrito. We all hide our true selves from the world with a wrapped-up covering. But inside, we host a plethora of fascinating offerings: cheese, rice, beans, chicken, and so much more. Inside my own burrito, I have my artistic eye and my caring heart. Those might constitute my beans and cheese. But someone else's cheese might be their love of surfing or their ability to speak ten languages. In conclusion, we should all unwrap our burritos and let the rice and beans spill out into a messy pile.

**The quirky, ""outside of the box"" essay**

i   a m APPLICANT

u    a r e ADMISSIONS OFFICER

p   l e   as e l et        m e      IN

**The sports injury essay**

It was the day of the big game. I had been preparing my whole life to play on that field that day. Sweat dripped down my face as I ran the warmup laps with my team. Suddenly I felt a horrible pain in my leg and I realized that I had stubbed my toe. ""NO!"" I gasped. ""Not on the day of the big game!""

Coach looked solemnly at me. ""Your career is over,"" he said. ""You can't play in the big game now.""

Suddenly his phone rang. He picked it up and frowned with concern. ""Oh no! Our star player has just come down with the flu and won't be able to play. Now we don't have enough players for the big game. We're going to have to forfeit.""

A burst of adrenaline coursed through my veins. ""No, we won't,"" I said, standing up resolutely. ""I'm going to play.""

Coach looked at me in awe.

That game I played like I had never played before, fighting through my agony for the team. Despite the unimaginable pain of my toe, I found it in me to score the winning goal. As I held the golden trophy above my head, I proudly realized that my hard work had gotten me here. Because, as Abraham Lincoln always said, winners never quit.

**The ""thesaurus"" essay**

I cherish to acquire comprehension in school, thus perusing volumes is my preoccupation. My incarnation is blithesome because I am disclosing new atmospheres and modes of quintessence. This scintillating diversion alleviates all malaises and obfuscations through elucidation. Whereas herein lies my denouement: construing utilization is my zeal.

**The sob story essay**

My life was never easy. I was born at a very young age, and was immediately plunged into hardship. I should have had a 4.9 GPA, however my numerous struggles have understandably resulted in my 1.7 GPA.

It all started with a birthday gift of AirPods. Unfortunately I received them just a week before the new AirPods 3 came out and everyone noticed my old-model AirPods and called me broke. Dear reader, the only thing broke was my heart. I couldn't even activate Siri with my model. However, I dusted myself off and trudged onwards. The next obstacle would be the one to shoot down my dreams. I had long hoped to launch a successful career as an Instagram influencer. With high hopes and my heart in my throat, I posted a selfie. To my horror, it received a measly 3 likes. This has wounded my spirit irreparably and I have since been struggling to cope. Obviously schoolwork has had to wait while I turn my attention to dealing with my greater problems.

**The overly descriptive essay**

At 6:35 am, I wake up and look at the lavender shade of my walls - not quite blue, not quite pink - and breathe in deeply. If my room were a clock, I have a periodic table poster above my closet at 3 o'clock, a world map slightly to the right of my desk at 9 o'clock, and a certificate for my work in cancer research at 11 o'clock. As I get up, I am aware of the white paint on my door and the soft fluff of my beige rug. Today is a cold day, about 65 degrees Fahrenheit or 18.3333 degrees Celsius. I slip on my puffy green winter jacket and my bright red Nikes and step outside onto the cracked gray sidewalk. As I walk, I glance at a small brown squirrel darting across the long black power line. Soon it is time for school, where I will fill my inquisitive mind with knowledge and apply my bountiful observational skills.

**The inspirational service trip essay**

Through my service trip to \[INSERT COUNTRY HERE\], I learned that helping others is good. This led to the realization that service is my passion. That is why I will be perfect for helping others by being a doctor/lawyer/CS programmer. As soon as I arrived in a poorer country with my $2,500 summer program, I started to miss the clean streets of my Silicon Valley neighborhood. But I took pictures with local children and followed my tour group around, so now I know just what it means to dedicate oneself to service. Here's the funny thing: I went to \[INSERT COUNTRY HERE\] to help others, but what I didn't know is that they had helped me. Due to the five days that I spent in \[INSERT COUNTRY HERE\] I have become more caring and aware and humble. These are all qualities that I will bring to the UC Hicago/St. Anford campus.

**The ""intellectual curiosity"" essay**

For as long as I can remember, I have always asked ""why?"" to everyone around me. As a child, I practically lived in libraries, carrying wagons of encyclopedias home every night. I blew through sixty books a day, and even that wasn't enough for my thicc brain. I had an unquenchable thirst for knowledge that could never be satisfied, not by Einstein's treatises on relativity, not by the Feynman physics lectures. By the age of three, I was writing academic papers with my crayons. In conclusion, I have am quite a curious intellectual. Harvard, please let me in.

If you have to study 24/7 and don’t have time for a social life just to maintain good grades and good test scores, you don’t belong at a top school. The people who belong at t20s are the people who actually have a life and passions beyond ‘I need a 4.0 GPA and 36 ACT’ they’re just smart enough to get the 4.0 and 36 on top of that. Y’all really need to chill because frankly not having a life is ruining your chances. When you look back and think ‘why did I get deferred/denied? I had a 4.0, I studied every single hour, I joined 7 different ECs just for this college’ then that is exactly why you got deferred/denied. Sure, there are some exceptions. But colleges don’t want people with no outside competence and no perspective which so many of you display them wonder why you’re not getting in to your top choices.

Edit: just because you didn’t get into a top school doesn’t mean that you necessarily have no personality! Top schools are always hard, getting rejected even with good scores could be a lot of reasons

31,b2sjij,False,Major Advice,95,It's the year 1767,ApplyingToCollege,"The College of Harvard and Stanford sent out their decisions four months ago so that the letters get delivered by carrier pigeons to the applicants' houses next week.

You open your letter and see ""we regret to inform you but there was an influx of qualified students who applied this year. Our acceptance rate had to drop from 96% to 94% because we only have enough space for 30 students and over 40 applied. Unfortunately, your dumb ass did not qualify"". It's unfair because you ran a successful business selling your family's eggs, helped draft the constitution, and even received an academic scholarship of $8.

You find that your neighbor George got into UPenn, where the acceptance rate dropped from 110% to 36%. His daddy owns a bomb ass hat factory and happens to make $1,000 a year while your fam makes $200 ($10 after taxes) a year. A scandal breaks out. Apparently, George's dad paid UPenn $500 and had a portrait painted of George posing on a buggy for the amish horse buggy UPenn racing team. George can't even tell the difference between a horse and a cow. Unfortunately, your dad being a legacy to harvard and donating $2 a year did not help you while George gets a whole straw hut named after him at UPenn.

Not to mention, George updated his facebook status to  ""UPenn class of 1772"" on the town news board and his dad bought him an apple islate x and you get the oldest version passed down to you by your 8th older sister.

You receive a letter a week after your rejection from the collegeboard that was mailed out last year apologizing for their failure to submit your SAT score because the mail guy's horse died halfway traveling from their HQ in texas to harvard in Boston. They refuse to refund you and you are out of $0.10

You have no choice but to attend your community college, where the teacher is 2 years older than you and there are kids ranging from 4-23 in your class, all learning the same things. You show up for the first day and see that they're just learning their abc's. The 22 year old dude in the class doesn't know the difference between the numbers 3 and 6. The teacher spends the rest of the first week of college teaching up to the letter ""q"" and the number 14. Meanwhile, george becomes a fuckin president and you end up being a goat farmer.

44,efh3em,False,Serious,130,Admissions broke me and I want everyone to know they don’t have to break you.,ApplyingToCollege,"Merry Christmas everyone! I just discovered this subreddit last night and was just absolutely fascinated by the content on this subreddit. I see a tremendous amount of good information, bad information, and misinformation. I just wanted to share with you all what it’s like going to college since I’ve just graduated and what that admissions process looked like for me.

As a senior in high school in 2014-2015, I had a ton of the same aspirations as the rest of the people on this subreddit. I had 4.0 GPA out of 4.0 (5th in my class) and 2120 on my SAT when it was out of 2400 (1460 composite with Math and English). To digress slightly, I just also want to tell everyone you can absolutely improve your SAT/ACT if you work hard enough, my PSAT was an 1080 Math and English composite. I forgot what I got on my two SAT II’s but both were in the 760+ range. All 5’s on my half-dozen AP tests in a variety of subjects. I was a varsity level soccer player, an Eagle Scout, and the President of the Literary Magazine. However, I was also a white, middle-class Long Islander who went to a Catholic high school. I knew that I wouldn’t be getting any extra bumps on my applications but I was certain I would be able to stand out.

I don’t blame my college guidance counselor for setting me up for anything, but she motivated me to apply to a lot of top programs on the East Coast and led me to believe that I can get into any of them, barring maybe one or two universities. 

I had a ton of high hopes. I applied to 18 colleges (something I totally discourage anyone from doing, it really should be 8-12 tops). It required a tremendous amount of effort, it was expensive, and if you’re a good student like I was, it can totally cripple your ability to make a decision come time. I sacrificed every waking moment that I wasn’t in school or doing something else for extracurriculars applying to colleges. 

The process was extremely tedious, frustrating, and aggravating. However, once those January deadlines hit, all I had to do was wait. 

In the meantime, my school had even nominated me for the Jefferson Scholarship at the University of Virginia. I then went through their own tedious application process. Thankfully, I was asked to interview and was then later told I was a finalist for the NYC area and would likely be invited to the final interview/selection process at UVA. I was elated. I truly thought I was going anywhere I wanted and my unstoppable work ethic (which I now realize was unhealthy) had finally payed off. My parents had assured me that I could go anywhere as well, depending on if they were good enough. I had a college fund, but I also have two siblings so it wasn’t substantial.

When everything began to come back, it started off extremely well. On a whim I had applied to Creighton (I love Big East basketball) and was shocked to find a package that included a full-ride offer and a handwritten letter from the Head of Admissions practically begging me to attend. There was also an offer to pay for my flight and accommodations to Omaha considering I hadn’t visited the campus. Everything was going great. Early action admissions came back and all of them included near or total scholarships, as well as acceptance into their honors programs. My life felt like a film about great success and overcoming hardship. I was happy about these admissions results, but none of the really top programs had gotten back to me yet at this point and of course I wasn’t going to attend any of these *peon* schools (if you couldn’t tell, I was becoming arrogant). 

Then February and March arrived. On the same day, I was deferred from UVA and denied from the Jefferson Scholarship, denied from Columbia, and waitlisted at Williams College. I was later denied from Georgetown (a school I legitimately thought was a safety for me, but I later learned they hadn’t accepted a student from my high school in 10+ years) and received no money from Boston College or Notre Dame. Schools I thought would give me more money ended up giving me none or not enough. I was also later denied from UVA and Williams College altogether.

Devastation doesn’t begin to describe what I felt. It’s normal to be upset about these types of things, but it’s not normal to refuse to eat for multiple days and either be crying or on the verge of tears at all waking hours. When I told my college guidance counselor about the results, all she could do was say she was sorry. I think she realized what she might’ve done and apologized to my parents for setting me up with these types of expectations. My parents told me how proud of me they were everyday but it didn’t matter. I genuinely felt worthless and stupid. I wanted to kill myself.

The worst part of this whole experience was that I also began to resent people who I considered my friends. I had a friend who was being *sued* by Columbia because she applied early decision only for her to be accepted into MIT and she pulled out. Multiple people I knew with worse SAT’s, extracurriculars, and GPA were all getting money from and/or into the schools I wanted to attend. Every word of reassurance became white noise. I didn’t know what to do and felt like my life was over. 

It is now the end of April and my parents are begging me to decide on what college to attend. I just start listing off the schools in terms of their rankings.

“Notre Dame”

“It’s too expensive.”

“Boston College”

“It’s too expensive.”

“Fordham”

“Your scholarship isn’t big enough.”

We then get to the schools that I can feasibly attend at their price range.  The thing is I didn’t want to attend any of them; they were beneath me and the work I had accomplished. I was completely obstinate to the reality of the situation. They said “you can basically attend these 4-5 colleges,” but they were really hoping I picked the one that multiple people in my town had attended and reportedly loved. However, I had hated my tour of the place and simply did not want to go there. The school did though offer me a 60% scholarship and entrance into their Honors Program. They even told me that a family friend’s daughter, who had been accepted into UVA, chose to attend this school and loved it. I was really upset and tried to stop myself from crying through the whole process, but I ultimately trusted their judgement. 

I can say with definite certainty that I tried to like the place I attended. I joined clubs, tried to meet people in the dorms, went to sporting events, etc. It just wasn’t working. I was so lonely and sad and angry about everything that I shut down. I still attended class and finished my first semester with a 4.0 having taken 19 credits, but it all felt hollow. I was dead-set on transferring out of there and was certain with my performance in college thus far, anywhere would be accessible. Someone had even told me transferring is the way to get into some of these programs. 

Not only was I rejected from all the top schools I had applied to the previous year, but I was rejected from some schools that had previously offered me scholarships! I was also beginning to hear from my friends who were a year younger than me getting into these programs I had wanted to attend, which hurt me further. With limited options, I realized I would have to graduate from my current college. I would be stuck there for four years. 

I’ve used the word devastation before, but it doesn’t really encapsulate the absolute darkness that encompassed me. I began to think I was an alien (not like a space alien). I felt like I had been lied to and that the world was for other people and not for me. 

At this point in time, I now recognize in hindsight that I was in the process of developing serious undiagnosed depression. I began to sleep for 16 hours a day and felt tired while I was awake. I would only eat when I felt I was about to faint from exhaustion/malnutrition. I kept trying to make friends and make the most out of my experience, but nothing was working. By the end of the year, I had been denied from the two clubs on campus that had the closest thing to a family bond/fraternity vibe to them.

Every day I thought about killing myself (I even took up smoking as a nonviolent way of slowly killing myself). I thought about the girl at Brown down the road who didn’t deserve her spot there while I lived in the closest thing to Hell on earth. I would pray to God every night begging him to tell me where I went wrong. 

I returned for my sophomore year in an even worse condition. I was eating less and sleeping even more. I was sleeping so much I was going to bed at 6PM and having trouble getting up for 8:30AM lectures. I looked awful. I had hair down to my back (I’m a guy), didn’t shower, and smoked half-a-pack of cigarettes a day. I couldn’t even do my work anymore, the one thing I valued myself on through my entire life. It was long process that will make a long story even longer, but this all culminated in me medically withdrawing from school in the Fall of my Junior Year. 

It took 9 months of therapy, medication, and love, but I willed myself back to that campus determined to just basically finish and get out of there.

I don’t know what it was, but a paradigm shift in my perspective occurred. I would like to state that I always thought my professors there were brilliant, I was just unhappy about the prestige of the school and my abysmal social life. But I began to realize that that these people are here because they (1) got offered a job in an extremely competitive field, and (2) because they themselves are extremely qualified. I don’t know why it took me so long, but the “esoteric knowledge” of the books I was reading was not limited to the faculty and resources in the schools I had wanted to attend. This made me feel substantially better about the education I was receiving. I also began to make genuine steps towards making friends. I was able to join one of the clubs I had been denied from in my freshman year. Funny enough, one of their responsibilities was giving tours! I was happy for the first time in a while.

Nevertheless, it was still difficult. My depression robbed me of much of the work ethic I once possessed. It took much more effort to do the same activities I could do with ease as a senior in high school or as a freshman. This means I did not graduate with a 4.0 (3.6, barely cum laude). However, I grew to love my school. It was a long and complex time, and I graduated a semester late, but I’m happy I went there. Apparently, I’m poised to win the top English prize for my senior thesis and am presenting at the Senior Symposium. Just to have the opportunity to thank my school and my professors for their help and guidance would be an incredible opportunity. 

I wrote this down as a way of expressing to others the obscene damage that the expectations you put on yourself can do to you. To be fair, I think I always predisposed to depression considering my fragile emotional state and this might’ve developed later in life but that’s beside the point. The catalyst for this all was my college applications. Hell, it mattered so much to me that when my dad told me that a family friend’s son had gotten into Yale a few days ago, I nearly cried and I’m already out of college. It’s fucking pathetic (but I recognize it’s fucked up and I’m still working on fixing myself).

But I’m not like most people. I was an elitist who wanted to join elitist institutions. I still do to an extent. I’m looking at all these scores on these tests that you guys post about and there’s tinges of envy popping up inside of me. Some of you might even think I was delusional for ever thinking I could go to those top programs in the first place, but hey, I and no one here will ever know why things turned out the way they did. But I also recognize now that for me to have been this upset about college admissions when I knew how things would turn out, I have no idea why I was so upset.

The thing is though, opportunity has found its way into every facet of my life. When God shut doors, he always opened windows whether I knew it or not. I’ve learned so much at college about my majors and myself it’s hard to think I could’ve wanted it any other way. I just want people to know that I know how rough and disappointing it can be. It’s not fair. But it’s also not designed to be fair. Don’t let these things stop you from becoming the person you are meant to be. I should’ve been able to see the overwhelming amount of positivity I received earlier in the process and realized just how much these schools were wrong about me. You will be accomplished anywhere you go. Don’t let *anyone* tell you that you’re not good enough. What some admissions officer thinks about your application is not indicative of who you are as a human being. It is not the total indictment of character and intelligence that I thought it was. 

I know this is so long and I genuinely respect anyone who’s read to the end of this, but if I have only one piece of advice for anyone here, it’s be kind to yourself. I was so profoundly unkind to myself for so long that my brain stopped working correctly. 

This will not define you. This goes both ways. Going to a “lesser” college means nothing of your intelligence. One of the biggest losers I know went to Columbia and he’s still a fucking loser a year after he graduated. It’s what you make of it. 

Enjoy your senior year of high school. Meet people. Have sex. Make mistakes. Drink too much. Discover what you love. Find out who you are. That’s what college is for and nearly any place will give you this opportunity.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/efh3em/admissions_broke_me_and_i_want_everyone_to_know/,3777,">1460 composite

Thank you so much for your help everyone, and I'm sorry I couldn't respond to everyone. I'd like to cherish the time I have time left before losing my phone. Also, I disagree with the moderator's decision to disable comments in the other thread about conscription. Firstly, there is important advice and information other redditors can contribute. Secondly, I feel that we need a discussion bringing awareness to the topic. I know this is A2C, but I don't see how enabling the comments for some discussion can hurt. It's important to people like me, and young people concerned about social justice.**

I'm a male dual citizen and apparently they have guidelines not well known to the public that if you don't follow, you will be conscripted for two years even if you're not from Korea. I don't even speak Korean.

What do I even tell Brown? Do I need to apply again in two years with new essays and everything? Will my high school SAT scores and GPA still be valid??

They caught me at the airport and I had to get escorted. I'm so scared. I cried too much today and the staff here don't seem to care; no one asked if I was alright and just walked by me as if they were used to this scene. I had no idea this could happen to me; I was only on vacation. All of a sudden I'm going to be isolated from society in some military camp just because I'm a dual-citizen male who didn't renounce his Korean citizenship before March of the year I turned 18. I already looked my situation up, and apparently this happens very regularly to unknowing Korean-Americans like me, and the US doesn't do anything about it. It's a trap designed to get more conscripts, and I'm a victim. There's no escape.

I'm sorry that I'm going into venting mode right now, but it feels like I'm fighting a battle alone with no one besides me. No social movement even talks about conscription even though it's a blatant violation of gender rights and human rights. I literally feel so alone and it's painful.

I also feel stupid and embarrassed. I'll have to explain to my friends about how I was stupid enough to not know to renounce my citizenship. It's embarrassing. Also, in Korean culture apparently, if you complain about military service, you're not a ""man"" so you have to stay silent about it. This means I can't talk to anyone I potentially befriend in Korea.

I have to explain to my roommates why I can't attend. I even made tons of close friends from the Facebook page. I was so happy about going. My life was set. Now I'm in a situation that I STILL feel like has to be a nightmare.

I'm so glad I wrote this post and getting my emotions out, but at the same time, I feel like I wasted the little time I have left before I get transported and my phone taken away. I honestly think I'll try to kill myself. I've heard horror stories of hazing, abusive/violent superiors, intense training starting 6 AM, and how the two years go by extremely slowly. My uncle told me stories about how he was punished by being locked inside a gas room where it disabled his eyes and made him cough. And how he was outcasted (he's autistic) and beat by his soldiers at times. And how he slept the latest and woke up the earliest because soldiers said they'd kill him in his sleep, and he believed it. He said it psychologically changed him and he's the main reason why I'm so scared of the military. You also get paid $110 a month so it's not like the US military

Looks like my question post turned into a rant post. I'd be thankful for any help you can give me, and PLEASE some words of encouragement and emotional support. I also stopped crying writing this post. I should also say thank you since I'll be offline for two years; you helped me a lot through admissions and I'm so grateful you guys exist.

64,e4lbef,False,None,138,You're not wasting your time.,ApplyingToCollege,"With early decisions coming out soon, the stress level on this sub has spiked. People post stuff like this:

>We all try so hard here for that 1600, 4.0, EC, jobs, etc for college and many of us...will go to a state school like everyone else who didn't try. We'll have everything we did for nothing. I feel like if I get rejected from T20s, I've accomplished nothing. My time has been wasted and I would have been in the same school if I had done nothing.

That got upvoted to hot. I'm not trying to call out OP, just point out that the sentiment is alive and well on this sub.

But it shouldn't be. **You might go to the same school as your less driven peers, but you'll come in with better opportunities and better skills.**

# Scholarships

Thinking plainly, if you're going to your state school but you're competitive for T20s, you'll get substantial scholarships. That's going to offset the cost of your education a lot, and there's a chance you could graduate debt-free, or close to it.

You might not fully appreciate that now, but I guarantee you will at 35, when all of your debt-ridden classmates are still paying 20% of their income to offset student loans. And if you do decide to go to grad school, you won't have to worry about the loans you took out for your undergrad.

# Honors Programs

Any state school is going to have a good honors college, which you'll be a member of. Here are just a few of the perks:

* **Priority registration for all of your classes.** This is a lifesaver at the bigger schools, where kids freak out the second registration opens and rush to get a spot in their preferred class (and usually don't get it). You'll never have to worry about your long-term graduation plan being thrown off because you couldn't sign up for a class on time, or have to settle for a class with a professor you don't like. You get first pick.
* **Priority and/or special housing.** Lots of colleges give honors kids the first pick of dorms, or they have the choice of living in honors housing. And with the wide range of housing at most state schools, from *built in the 1910s and falling apart* to *modern tech paradise built 2 years ago*, you'll be extremely grateful. Plus, honors housing builds a community for you and lets you find academically minded peers.
* **Specialized advising and mentoring.** Going to a big state school, or even a T20, means you'll probably see your advisor a few times a year, usually just to schedule classes. With honors programs, you have a counselor dedicated to you, and you can meet with them regularly. Obviously this is super helpful when you're looking for opportunities like internships or summer programs. Plus, you'll get connected to a mentor in your field of interest, and growing that relationship will give you access to a lot of amazing programs you won't have known about otherwise.
* **Honors classes/seminars.** Not a thing at all schools, but some state schools let you take a few Honors-only classes, which tend to be much more discussion-based. They're also capped at a much smaller number of students, so your learning is much more personalized.

# Advanced Standing Opportunities

You know all those AP/IB/dual credit classes you're taking? Remember how the whole point is to get you college credit? It actually transfers at state schools, unlike most T20s. You can build a much more personalized schedule, from graduating early, double-majoring, skipping weed-outs, or just enjoying your classes more than if you were forced to take ""Intro to Physics"" as an English major.

For me, my AP classes clear away all but 6 credit hours of a 32 credit hour gen-ed requirement at my state school. I could graduate a year early, but because my scholarships are so nice, I'd probably take 4 years and leave with a major, related minor, and 3 school-year internships in my desired field. I wouldn't have that much course flexibility if I went to a T20, and it's honestly a big reason why I'm considering staying in-state.

# Resume and College ECs

No matter what, the tangible stuff disappears once you reach college--you won't be MUN President or LD State Champion--but the lessons you learn from your ECs don't. You're going to enter college with better time management and organization, better soft skills, and better understandings of what it takes to run an organization like a club.

That stuff can stay on your resume until you build up college honors. If it's freshman year and you're trying to get an internship in your field, you'll have the EC experience that shows you understand what you're doing. When you're competing with other underclassmen, or even some juniors, internships/competitions/leadership shows that you know what's going on.

That experience also makes it easier for you to dive into campus extracurriculars so you can build up your resume and keep doing the things you loved to do in high school. At your state school, you'll be a big fish. You'll be able to take up leadership more quickly and be a star within the clubs. You'll get to be fully immersed in what you're doing as extracurriculars, not just a minor role like you might be at T20s.

# You've put yourself on a track for success no matter where you go. State schools will throw opportunities at you, and not everyone gets that opportunity. Don't forget that.

68,fow4w1,False,Serious,110,"Ivy Day is the Anniversary of my Suicide Attempt, and this is what I want to tell you",ApplyingToCollege,"TW: suicide, psych ward, drugs, arson, emotional abuse

Four years ago today, I was spending my ""last"" twenty-four hours writing notes to friends and family, and silently saying goodbye to all the things I thought I'd never see again: icicles glistening under the sun. Trees. Honey-nut cheerios. Gel pens. Back then, I couldn't picture myself living another day, much less graduating high school, applying to colleges, or dreaming of a future. But somehow, against the odds, I made it. I made it through the bright lights of the ER, as doctors worked frantically around me sticking IVs in my veins and prodding my face. I made it through the psych ward, living with drug-dealers from juvie and eight year olds who tried to burn down their schools. I made it through months of crushing shame, my parents screaming at me with disappointment, and shrinks who told me that I was a lost cause.

Because here's the thing that I want to say to us--on the eve of Ivy Day, no matter what shit goes down tomorrow and how bitter and disappointed we are with your results--even if it feels like our worlds are collapsing, we'll get through this. This one's for us: for all of those late nights studying APs, IBs, SATs, and ACTs, all those days we were so worn-down from Sports and EC board nominations and friend drama that we fell asleep at our desks, all those moments we ducked into the school bathrooms and thought, *I can't do this*.

Because we've made it. We DID do it. We've already worked so unbelievably hard and have come so unbelievably far, and even if we aren't rewarded tomorrow, we've already won. Those flimsy paper ""regret to inform you""s? They are NOTHING compared to what we've accomplished and how hard we've worked. They do not define us. They do not summarize four years of tears and sweat and grit. They will never know our full stories and how much we've overcome.

So this is the beginning of a lifetime, not the end of a journey.

If you get into your dream school? Congrats! But you're still going to have to work hard these next four. If you get rejected? Congrats! It's now a chip on your shoulder to keep busting ass. We are so young. We are SO young. We are seventeen and eighteen and nineteen and bursting with promise, and as long as we work hard, stay hungry, and learn as much as we can with what we're given, we're going to succeed and we're going to be happy.

Whatever happens tomorrow is the universe's plan for you. Before you open that first decision, take a moment to reflect, to be proud of all you've done and everything you've become. No matter what happens next, you are ready.

Saddle up.

72,g2hzat,False,Rant,243,My high school class is boycotting online classes. This is wrong.,ApplyingToCollege,"Yesterday, my HS principal sent a blast email saying that the Class of 2020's prom was cancelled, the senior awards would be presented online, the summa cum laude recognition would also be held online, and the final sting: in-person graduation was cancelled. 

This morning, in our senior class Facebook group, several of my peers decided they would organize a ""senior skip day"" for online school to express their disappointment in our administration. Just a few hours ago, another student shared a long, heart-wrenching email that she sent to our district superintendent, which went into detail about her mom who has cancer and won't make it to her college graduation, wedding, etc. The student's high school graduation, which the mom would've been able to attend, was gone. She has poured kerosene to the flames.

I'm mad our graduation is gone, too. I immigrated to the States with my family when I was 8 years old, and for the past three years, I've been telling my single mom that I'd work to deliver a speech in my high school graduation to tell everyone in the stadium about the sacrifices she's made and express just how thankful I am for her. A normal thank you wouldn't convey my gratitude; a thank you in front of thousands of people, however, could. I also wanted to celebrate how much I've grown as an individual, and thank my friends who were there for me when I ran away from home, encountered a period of depression, etc. Only a proper thank you in front of thousands could express my gratitude.

No matter how disappointed I am at the news of my graduation's cancellation, I do not doubt for a second the decision that my district administration made. What if just one person--out of the thousands that would attend the gathering--brought the coronavirus? Dozens--if not more--would catch it. What if the girl, whose mom has cancer, acquires the virus and brings it home with her? What will happen to her mother with breast cancer? To the girl: I understand your heartbreak, but what would your mom do? I hope she would choose to protect the lives of hundreds, including hers, at the sacrifice of an monumental experience--a choice that I consider heroic and wise.

All it takes is one--one out of thousands--to put the lives of dozens in danger. What if all--no, just a few hundred--of the high schools across the US hosted graduations? The physical, economic damage will be unimaginable. We seniors might not even have the fall semester of college. Do we need the spring semester off as well?

Now, I stay home to protect my 50-year-old mom. This is how I express my gratitude for her. I haven't seen a single person outside my family for the past few weeks in order to protect my family. Most of the students here have parents who are aged 50 or older, and let's protect them by staying home.

I don't know who she was talking to, but I'm assuming it was to a relative or a friend, since my mom is part of the Chinese community in my town that loves to gossip about college and especially about which colleges their kids will be attending. I left at that point and don't really know how I've been feeling since, and I guess that's why I'm venting here. 

&nbsp;

So basically, my parents are both from China and met while they were both graduate students at Harvard. Ever since I was young, they constantly made it clear to me that Harvard was the only school that they wanted me to attend. Basically everything they made me do was to make me a more competitive applicant and increase my chances of getting into Harvard. They built up this expectation that I'd follow their legacy and didn't even consider that I might not get in. Fast forward to last December, and I found out I was deferred after applying early action. My parents were clearly disappointed, but still held out hope that I'd be accepted in the regular admissions cycle. Then, on decision day, I got my rejection letter and couldn't even look my parents in the eye. After getting all my decisions, I considered my choices and decided to attend Northwestern.

&nbsp;

Ever since, I could tell that they've been disappointed in me, even though they never said it to my face. It was always small comments like ""oh I heard (insert name here) from your school got into Harvard, what do you think they did that you didn't?"" or ""I think Northwestern's a good school, but it's not in the same league as Harvard."" Hearing my mom literally cry on the phone because I didn't get into Harvard was the confirmation I needed that they were, in fact, disappointed in me as their son. I'm sorry Mom, that I wasn't good enough to get into Harvard. I really fucking tried, okay? Northwestern's a good school too, I wish you could be happy that I was going there instead.

81,exvs5i,False,None,212,A Declaration of Independence against the Collegeboard,ApplyingToCollege," When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for students to protest the injustices imposed on them by an oppressive organization, they must declare the causes which motivate them to the protest.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all students have the right to sanity, not getting ripped off, and decent educational standards. That, whenever any organisation in control of students becomes destructive to these ends, then it becomes reasonable to protest their injustices. To prove this, let us state the facts of this organization.

1. The cost for the SAT is $47.50. **$47.50** to take a multiple choice test
2. Hardly any multiple choice tests are released to students to study from. My calc teacher makes new tests and quizzes EVERY YEAR
3. In order to gain access to questions, students must buy books CREATED by the college board so they make money
4. The president of the college board, a non profit organization, made 1.3 MILLION in 2009. Over twice sal khan's salary at khan academy and more than the Red Cross president salary.
5. For having a monopoly over financial aid and testing products
6. For having to pay $12 PER COLLEGE to sent scores. To send a number
7. To have to pay $16 PER COLLEGE to send a financial aid report (the irony). Meanwhile the FAFSA is completely free
8. Paying 19 executives over $300,000 a year from student money
9. For having multiple reporting errors in their [process](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/eqbkfe/fuck_the_college_board/)
10. Having to pay $98 dollars to go through an AP exam (3 hours of death)
11. In addition to these $98, students have to pay for study materials due to lack of resources posted online
12. For playing mind games with students (you can send your score to 4 colleges for free before you get your score report or pay to send to colleges after you get your scores????? What??)
13. For selling student data [College Board Search — Pricing and Payment Policies](https://collegeboardsearch.collegeboard.org/pastudentsrch/support/licensing/pricing-payment-policies) without making them sufficiently aware [The College Board's Student Privacy Pledge Status – Pledge to Parents & Students](https://studentprivacypledge.org/the-college-boards-student-privacy-pledge-status/)
14. Recycling SAT exams allowing for cheating
15. Rush shipping is an extra $15. So they can ship it early but they don’t just to milk money

In every stage we have petitioned to our oppressors, yet they have not answered our complaints.

83,frr16n,False,Discussion,79,Juniors - Harvard sending you mail literally means nothing,ApplyingToCollege,"Last year around this time, Harvard sent me a packet asking me to apply. I was in the shower and my mom saw it. She proceeded to take a picture of it and send it to every family member. We didn’t have plans for spring break (this happened like two weeks before it) and she’s like “lol now we need to go to Boston.” Since it was spring break for most schools around the country, they had no tours. She literally made me email the office of admissions and like “ummm excuse me but I got a package from you! You need to get me on a tour!” And they said “no peasant.” We ended up taking a trip to the northeast to do visits (not at Harvard lol)

Anyway, getting letters/packages from schools like Harvard mean nothing. If you hadn’t heard of this already, here’s what happens:

Harvard (along with other schools) want to have as low as an acceptance rate as possible. They don’t want to decrease the size of incoming classes so therefore they have to have a large applicant pool. How do they do that? Sending thousands of high schoolers letters encouraging them to apply. Kids think “wow! Harvard wants me!” But no, honey. They just want your application.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/frr16n/juniors_harvard_sending_you_mail_literally_means/,3012,"This is largely anecdotal, but I actually applied to Harvard and got my application fee waived (so I lost nothing by applying). They sent someone to interview me in my state, and we talked a bit.  According to my interviewer, part of what you say is true, but another reason Harvard and other universities spam out applications is that they want ""well rounded"" students. I never went to high school or did traditional ""extracurriculars"" outside off some sports, so I didn't make that cut. Some people are well rounded, and those are the people Harvard tries to  find.

Yale was a bit more straight forward and said. ""You're applying with effectively half a BS already completed. We don't accept credits taken from your college and greatly prefer high school students."" ",2020-03-30 13:43:41

Now these videos are all on Youtube so you can visit them without leaving home!

The Art of College: [https://www.youtube.com/c/theartofcollege](https://www.youtube.com/c/theartofcollege)

Website: [artofcollege.org](https://artofcollege.org)

(**please** spread the word by hitting that like button, leaving a comment, or sharing on your social media!)

&#x200B;

**In each video, there are some stats by ""looking down"":**

\- USNews undergrad rank from 2010 - 2015 - 2020

\- Full undergrad cost of attendance. I couldn't find this info aggregated anywhere so I went to every school's website and added tuition+room+board+fees+insurance, basically everything you need to budget for 1 school year.

\- Average undergrad starting salary from Payscale.com

\- SAT ranges (new 1600 SAT)

\- Undergrad early and regular deadlines

\- Nearest major city and relevant stats

&#x200B;

**When walking/driving outside of buildings:**

\- Each video also has at least 10 fun facts that I felt really define that school. I hand picked these after reading from Fiske's Guide, Princeton Review guide, reviews from students at [unigo.com](https://unigo.com/), and online about the colleges. After reading hundreds of comments about each college, you end up with a ""feel"" for what's unique and what's the same everywhere.

&#x200B;

**For more immersive playback**

1. Youtube defaults to 720p – 1080p playback, which is too low for 360° video. Click the settings icon and change to 4k for MUCH better quality.
2. Playback on your phone/ipad tends to be much smoother than playback on PC (unless your PC has dedicated graphics card)
3. For wider field of view, play back on your computer in full screen mode (F11) and scroll down on your mouse. You’ll get about 1-2 notches on your scroll wheel before the page itself starts to scroll down. This is the widest field of view, press Page Up to go back up to the top of the video and enjoy the wider field of view!

is this you? IS THIS THE RIGHT EMAIL?

I have not yet received your application to our obscure college with a funny name and an 80% acceptance rate. What gives? Are you feeling suicidal?

Please review these pictures of grassy fields and smiling college-aged students and reconsider your decision to ignore our school.

Still not interested? Maybe you are poor! Allow us to waive the application fee so you can more easily seal your fate to a life of mediocrity and ""huh, I've never heard of that college"".

Even though you will never go here, please allow me to conclude this email with an aggressive comment and a pretentious footer.

I look forward to reviewing your application,

They think I got in because of my scholarly records, but no the key is the interview. As I sat in the Harvard Dean's office in front of the board of reviewers for my application, the Dean asks me ""Why should you be a good candidate for this school?"" They seemed bored but I replied ""Well I was born a child prodigy, placed 1st in my state spelling bee for three consecutive years, I can speak eight different languages not counting Latin, play four different instruments, I skipped grades 4 through 6, and graduated my high school as valedictorian at the age of 14. I then worked as an intern at both Telsa, and NASA."" Suddenly the room burst into laughter and many of board instantly started scribbling down ""No"" near the application check marks. The Dean says ""Sorry but you are just not the type we are looking for."" But then I said ""Excuse me but I wasn't finished... I watch Rick and Morty"" The Dean looked at me like an idiot and said ""So....?"" Then I replied with a smile ""And I understand all the references and subtle jokes"" An audible gasp let out by the board was so loud the secretary had to come in. You could hear a pin drop and then suddenly all at once the entire board clicked their pens on the ""Approved Box"" and I was instantly handed a diploma and now I'm teaching advanced physicals there.

Can't say that I wasn't disappointed but I moved on fairly quickly. Come 29 February and I receive an email saying there is an ""application update"", which has to be the most confusing moment for me in this whole process. I go open my portal and see a ""financial aid award letter"". Clicked on that and... it's a full ride! If I hadn't received the rejection letter, I would have been ecstatic but I felt nothing but confusion. I go back and forth between my rejection letter and financial aid award letter to make sure I wasn't hallucinating, and everything was in order (except being rejected with financial aid). I finally decide to email the school to get some clarification. They replied, apologized for the mistake and said they had mixed up my ID number with someone else's. They pulled the financial aid letter from my portal and kept the rejection letter. I don't know how to feel about this. I would be lying if I said I didn't have a brief moment of hope.

104,glpyt7,False,Exams,216,2020 APs are simply unfair,ApplyingToCollege,"Long rant below:

1. **Questions are not equal in difficulty:** The AP tests are not curved, and thus there is a preset number of points necessary for a certain score. That would be okay if the tests were like normal, but when there are tons of different prompts for tons of different students, how can you guarantee equal difficulty? Especially in a problem set with only two problems. How can you say one DBQ is objectively equal in difficulty to another? In my personal experience, the AP Physics 1 test seems to completely vary in difficulty. You have some problems that are straightforward fundamentals and others that are far more complicated. It seems completely unfair, and with the College Board not releasing much information on how different problems will be graded, it honestly makes some students who clearly received more difficult prompts feel left in the dark.
2. **A 45-minute test is not enough to test 1 year's worth of material**. When you have a test that is in a new environment, with the added stress of submitting your test in the given time, there is such a high chance of making one stupid mistake. When the tests are normal, one stupid mistake is okay because you have the rest of the test to compensate. But when you're tested with such a small number of questions, getting caught on a question/slipping up once or twice can drastically change your score. On top of that, so much is based simply on how lucky you get with your prompt. In all honesty, I am much better at physics than apush, but got a prompt on apush that I was very knowledgable about and got a prompt on physics that I was not as knowledgable about. With such a small test, there is simply just too much variance for it to be an accurate representation of one's knowledge. 
3. **The College Board did not release enough materials in preparation**. The College Board really emphasized their platform, releasing tons of information on how it was going to work and how students should take the test. While this was helpful, it is important to note that some tests this year, notably maths and sciences, were drastically changed. All the College Board did to compensate for this change was to release 2 practice tests online on their YouTube channel, but these tests 1. seemed to be rough estimates of the actual test and not reflect the test much and 2. are simply not enough for students. The College Board consistently writes convoluted questions in efforts to make questions on simple concepts more difficult. When one has experience with these questions, they can get used to the format, but without much practice of the new format, the test felt almost completely blind. 
4. **Foreign students** have to take the tests at ridiculous times. I don't know much about this as I live in America, but it seems that kids in foreign countries have to take the tests either ridiculously early or ridiculously late.

113,f8dxcz,False,Fun/Memes,115,The Ivy League vs The Techvy League,ApplyingToCollege,"After years of public pressure from pretentious high schoolers and their parents, the Ivy League - Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Columbia, UPenn, Brown, and Dartmouth - finally voted to kick Cornell out of the Ivy League. In an official statement released to the press, Harvard, representing the League, explained that ""Cornell had failed to maintain the humanities and liberal arts focus necessary to stay in the League"".

Cornell supporters were devastated, claiming that this decision was an attack against Cornell's high acceptance rate and its mission to educate the masses. The Institutes of Technology - MIT, Caltech, GeorgiaTech - watched as the debacle unfolded. Together, they decided that they would do something to right the wrong. 

On a Tuesday morning, Cornell received a phone call, ""Hi Cornell, it's MIT. We have some things to discuss...""

Cornell arrived at The Conference. Inside, sat MIT, Caltech, and GeorgiaTech. ""We've brought in some powerhouses to help us with what we're about to do"", MIT announced.

Carnegie Mellon entered the room. UC Berkeley entered the room. Stanford entered the room. 

A document was passed around, gaining signatures from each of the schools. On it, read ""The reign of the Ivy-League ends today.""

On September 1st, 2025, the Techvy League declared war on the Ivy League, flooding the airwaves with billions of negative attack ads.

MIT vs Harvard

Stanford vs Princeton

UC Berkeley vs Yale

CalTech vs Columbia

Carnegie Mellon vs UPenn

Cornell vs Brown

GeorgiaTech vs Dartmouth. 

During the 2025-2026 admission season, acceptance rates for each of the Ivy League institutions rose to an all-time high while acceptance rates for the Techvy League institutions fell to a record low. Slowly but surely, Ivy League alumni stopped providing donations to their alma maters, and endowments at each of the Ivy League schools began to dwindle. 

By 2033, 8 years after the war had started, the Ivy League surrendered. Running out of money and no longer able to fill their freshman classes, the Ivy League had come to the end of the road. Brown, Dartmouth, UPenn, and Columbia had already boarded up their campuses while Harvard, Princeton, and Yale pleaded for mercy. None was granted. 

In 2035, the Ivy League institutions are nothing but a memory.

124,e7zlez,False,Meta Discussion,219,Unpopular Opinion: A2C is a toxic sub,ApplyingToCollege,"For context, I'm a freshman in college who spent a lot of time lurking in this  sub last year. There's so much anxiety and fear over the college application process and honestly so much of it **doesn't fucking matter**. If you don't get into that prestigious-ass 1-10% acceptance rate university? You'll be fine. Seriously. Would it be great to go to a crazy good school? Sure. Definitely.  If you don't get into your ""Dream School""It's not the end of the world.

I feel like this sub pushes the elitist mindset that, ""you must get a 33+ ACT & have 20 different ECs & have a 5.6 GPA (how do you guys even do this? I don't think that was even possible at my school but okay?)"" and I'm not here for it. This sub seems inaccessible to people with lower scores or different situations because it's very intimidating posting your stats if they are less than everyone else posting.

It also seems like this sub fosters a sort of anxious and dramatic tension. You can get lost in the worried haphazard posts talking about essays and applications, and it's draining.

I even cringe at the term ""Dream School"". Honestly, y'all have no freaking idea of what your dream school is like (I sure a s hell didn't going into orientation) and I've met so many people who regret their choice.  One thing I've realized in college is **how important fit is.** you should not go to a college just just because it's ""the best school you can get into"" because at the end of the day you need to put up with the environment you will be living in.

Learn as much as you can about the school you want to go to, and don't stress too much if you don't get into your first choice. The end of senior year will come earlier than you expect, so fucking enjoy your last year in HS.

Finally, getting into your ""Dream School"" over a less attractive school won't alleviate your problems. I had this mindset and boy was I in for a nasty surprise as I had to face academic hardship and a new college social scene at the same time.

I was in the IB programme, and my GPA was around a 3.1 with a handful of Cs and 2 Ds. I had a 1370 on my SAT which is good, but not incredible. At the end of my junior year, I realized that I was only setting myself up for failure in life and I wanted to start trying in school for once. I would go to places like collegeconfidential and feel like shit about myself because of my grades. Sites like these naturally attract the high achievers, which is fine, but it's demoralizing going online trying to get a better education and seeing peers list your reaches as safeties.

I ended up going to a state school for college (not going to name names for privacy reasons, but think Ohio State, Arizona State, etc.) and found a subject I was passionate about.

136,hnrx60,False,Shitpost Wednesdays,121,Should I put having a girlfriend as an extra curricular?,ApplyingToCollege,"Hey guys, I am currently in a relationship and I was wondering if I could put that as an extra curricular activity? I'll put down a few reasons why.

1. Like I do a lot for her and I think colleges need to know that's why some of my test scores were lower than average (1580 SAT and 35 ACT). The week before my SAT, she made us go on a date together, and she gave me really good head and all, but I needed to be studying for the SAT. Because of that lost time, my score dropped by 20 points. I think this will affect my chances at getting into Princeton.
2. She is about a 7/10 while I am about a 9.3/10.  So I feel like I am doing charity/volunteer work by being with her because I have better options. I believe I am helping raise her popularity since I am so attractive, so I should be entitled to service hours.
3. Being with her feels like a part-time job but I have to pay. Do you know how expensive Olive Garden is? Whenever we go I gotta be like girl I know you want to get Pepsi and all, but I'm broke. Speaking of which should I write my essay about how being in this relationship taught me the value of money? Because her Chicken Alfredo was LITERALLY 16 DOLLARS , so I couldn't order an entree and I ate like twelve bread sticks.
4. Also I want to show Colleges that I am a well rounded individual not just some insensitive math nerd. I listen to her from time to time. For instance, 2 months ago she told me she was craving a Crunch Wrap Box from Taco Bell, but that was too expensive so I got her a McChicken instead.

What do you guys think? Should I put this as an extra curricular to show how nice and likable I am?

137,gqbyw5,False,Discussion,258,Essay of the girl that got into 8 Ivies,ApplyingToCollege,"""In our house, English is not English. Not in the phonetic sense, like short a is for apple, but rather in the pronunciation – in our house, snake is snack. Words do not roll off our tongues correctly – yet I, who was pulled out of class to meet with language specialists, and my mother from Malaysia, who pronounces film as flim, understand each other perfectly.
In our house, there is no difference between cast and cash, which was why at a church retreat, people made fun of me for “cashing out demons.” I did not realize the glaring difference between the two Englishes until my teacher corrected my pronunciations of hammock, ladle, and siphon. Classmates laughed because I pronounce accept as except, success as sussess. I was in the Creative Writing conservatory, and yet words failed me when I needed them most.
Suddenly, understanding flower is flour wasn’t enough. I rejected the English that had never seemed broken before, a language that had raised me and taught me everything I knew. Everybody else’s parents spoke with accents smarting of Ph.D.s and university teaching positions. So why couldn’t mine?
My mother spread her sunbaked hands and said, “This is where I came from,” spinning a tale with the English she had taught herself.
When my mother moved from her village to a town in Malaysia, she had to learn a brand new language in middle school: English. In a time when humiliation was encouraged, my mother was defenseless against the cruel words spewing from the teacher, who criticized her paper in front of the class. When she began to cry, the class president stood up and said, “That’s enough.”
“Be like that class president,” my mother said with tears in her eyes. The class president took her under her wing and patiently mended my mother’s strands of language. “She stood up for the weak and used her words to fight back.”
We were both crying now. My mother asked me to teach her proper English so old white ladies at Target wouldn’t laugh at her pronunciation. It has not been easy. There is a measure of guilt when I sew her letters together. Long vowels, double consonants — I am still learning myself. Sometimes I let the brokenness slide to spare her pride but perhaps I have hurt her more to spare mine.
As my mother’s vocabulary began to grow, I mended my own English. Through performing poetry in front of 3000 at my school’s Season Finale event, interviewing people from all walks of life, and writing stories for the stage, I stand against ignorance and become a voice for the homeless, the refugees, the ignored. With my words I fight against jeers pelted at an old Asian street performer on a New York subway. My mother’s eyes are reflected in underprivileged ESL children who have so many stories to tell but do not know how. I fill them with words as they take needle and thread to make a tapestry.

In our house, there is beauty in the way we speak to each other. In our house, language is not broken but rather bursting with emotion. We have built a house out of words. There are friendly snakes in the cupboard and snacks in the tank. It is a crooked house. It is a little messy. But this is where we have made our home.""

You sum up your entire existence into 600 words. You delete a hundred of those words to not make it too tedious to read.

I thought I'd share it again this year to console all you seniors about your rejections. I'm on a new account because I couldn't log into my throwaway account again.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A week before my freshman year of high school, my (overbearing) Asian parents took me to a private college counselor's office. This person used to be an AO at Stanford, quit her job, and now spends her time coaching students to build the perfect resume to get into super selective colleges.

""So, what do you like to do in your free time?""

""I like hiking and naturery stuff"" I said.

""That's not academic enough. Anything else?""

""Uh idk. I like art I guess,"" I choked.

After some humming and hawing and lots of googling things on her laptop, my counselor told me that I needed to do something ""community-minded"" with my interests. ""How about starting an art collective for low-income neighborhoods of color?"" she suggested. **It seemed like she literally just pulled out some ""buzzwords"" that would look good on my resume,** and I wasn't too interested in the prospect. I stared at her for a solid 30 seconds before my mom said ""yes, (my name) would love to do that.""

I remember this moment so clearly because 1. It was the decision to pursue the activity that probably got me into Stanford, and 2. I knew I wasn't interested in it from the very beginning, but I also knew that AOs would never catch my lack of interest. I mean are they mind readers? Of course not. For the record, lots of my supplements (including my Stanford one) talked about how ""I was driven to empower students from East San Jose/ Oakland from the beginning of my journey,"" but clearly, that's not the case. And AOs never noticed, **as both my Stanford and Yale regional AO gave me hand-written, physical notes in my acceptance packages telling me how they ""could just feel my enthusiasm for using art as a praxis of empowerment.""**

So yeah, ""an art collective for low-income neighborhoods of color""... I emailed a couple local non profits. I started teaching oil painting and creative writing to poor middle schoolers at an after school club. I liked it, but it probably wasn't something I'd pursue on my own without the motivation of college admissions. It got big. *Sophomore year, I got super-competitive grants from 3 well-recognized foundations. Junior year, I got an award from Princeton and another award from a really big non profit recognizing me for my efforts.* **But we all know that I wasn't truly passionate about this.**

**So what happens after high school graduation?** The kids who run foundations/ non-profits/ programs, at least in my super competitive silicon valley suburb, don't go on to keep up this facade for the rest of their lives (why would they?). Most of the kids in my area, myself included, went on to major in econ/CS and sell our souls out to a giant tech company/ investment bank/ consulting firm after graduation. \*\*Despite our liberal political inclinations, few Stanford students graduate and truly go on to advocate for the communities they supposedly dedicated themselves to in high school.\*\*Sure, there are some exceptions.

But for the most part, there's a huge campus mentality of ""ditching your high school self"" and ""getting to live a little for the next 4 years"" on the Farm because **a good portion of us--especially unhooked applicants like myself--spent almost all of our high school years to get into schools like Stanford.**(There was actually a book written by a Yale professor about this phenomena: Excellent Sheep by William Deresiewicz. Highly recommend you read the book if you're a senior trying to decide between a selective and a non-selective school atm).

That's why I'm always confused and angry when AOs and some high school students say ""just follow your passion"" and ""we can tell when applicants do ECs they aren't passionate about"" or ""to get into HPYS, you have to be genuinely interested in what you do;"" and the worst one, ""be authentic! AOs can tell when you aren't being yourself."" **No, they can't.** They can only tell when 1. You're using cliched tropes, and 2. You aren't as successful in your endeavors as you could've been. ***Stanford, and nearly any ultra selective college for that matter, is full of kids who are incredibly successful but not necessarily passionate in what they did in high school.***

So if any underclassmen are reading this, just remember: **if you're aiming for HYPS, aim for excellence--not necessarily authenticity.** I mean if I spent my high school years doing what I loved the most, I would've spent them hiking, painting (I'm decent at it but not good enough to get Stanford's attention), writing (ditto with painting) and getting high. That most likely wouldn't have led me to Stanford.

TL;DR: **If you got rejected from your dream schools this week don't feel bad**\--despite what AOs say, they cannot truly determine the emotional investment you've poured into your ECs or academics.

&#x200B;

Edit from this year: A sophomore at Stanford who's kinda Twitter famous had this one tweet that read:

***Elite universities are pillars of a colonial past, present, and future. Institutions like st\*nford, h\*rvard, etc. are not meant to mold free thinkers, only the next generation of capitalists & imperialists.***

Think about that the next time you see a Stanford or Harvard grad proclaiming to do good for the world in their college apps only to do a complete 180 flip (\*cough [pete buttigieg](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2019/03/all-about-pete) cough\*).

176,cqkgri,False,None,280,Poor kids have it worse. In response to middle class complaints on this sub.,ApplyingToCollege,"It's a pretty common notion here that middle class kids get fucked over the worst with financial aid - because rich kids can afford to pay in full, and poor kids qualify for lots of aid. And I'm not going to refute that middle class people do get fucked over quite often. Middle class kids often don't qualify for the aid that they would benefit from, and that's not a good thing.

The notion that middle class kids have it *worse* than poor kids is incredibly insensitive and wrong, though.

Someone made a comment on one of the recent front page ""the middle class gets the shortest end of the stick :("" posts with something to the effect of ""the poor will always have it worse"" and I want to echo that sentiment and make sure some of y'all get a little clarity on what being poor is actually like.

So sure, poor kids get a lot of financial aid. Might get all of their tuition, all of their room and board paid for. That doesn't account for all the other expenses, though. That doesn't account for food, for all of the living supplies like toiletries, cleaning supplies, new sheets because nobody owns a Twin XL at home. And while everyone has these expenses, they're a lot bigger of a burden on poor people, and y'all better not have the audacity to try and refute that. Simply living on a day to day basis can be a challenging expense for some folks.

I'll use the disclaimer that I'm poor, so yeah, I'm going to be more sensitive to my fellow poor kids. I got over 3/4 of my tuition and housing paid for with need-based aid. But that's only the beginning of the expenses. I feel guilty buying the things that I need to live in college. Even buying things from the thrift store and the dollar store - I still feel horrible for the burden it is on my parents. Because that's what it's like. Buying sheets is a burden. Buying a hamper for my laundry. Paying for laundry. Paying for books. We already skimp on breakfast sometimes if we haven't gotten paid yet and don't have the spare fucking 2 dollars for a dozen eggs. I'm worried for how they'll fare this year after I've left, with monthly tuition bills on top of every other expense.

Being poor isn't some great circumstance that middle class kids should somehow envy. It fucking sucks. And while I understand that it's frustrating not to receive financial aid, I promise you that you are NOT getting the shortest end of the stick. It's really disheartening and disgusting to see people on here acting like being middle class is the worst thing that happened to them, and that somehow, they've got it worse off than poor people. **Being poor isn't worth all the financial aid in the world.**

Sorry if this comes off as mean, but I'm at my wits' end and I'm absolutely disgusted with the misunderstanding of poorness on this sub. Not everybody here acts like it, but I have seen far too many posts here complaining about how middle class kids have it the worst for college, and far too many of them are making it to the front page. I understand your frustration. But not one of you would want to live a day in a poor kid's shoes. It's insensitive to erase those struggles and act as though your lack of financial aid is a bigger problem than things like, I don't know, poverty.

Inb4 ""struggle is not a competition"" I know it isn't. But there are people on this sub acting like it is and that they've got it the worst, when there are so many other struggles in this community.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/cqkgri/poor_kids_have_it_worse_in_response_to_middle/,2241,"Thank God I'm getting married, will appear poor on the FAFSA but still have help from middle class parents ",2019-08-15 03:22:34

190,9qfjl5,False,Other Discussion,137,A little bit of perspective from a 21 y/o college student,ApplyingToCollege,"So, I did everything right in high school. Great grades (APs/Honors courses too), stellar SAT and ACT scores (back when it was out of 2400!), leadership positions, national debate awards. I got some acceptances to private universities, some rejections. I got three full rides to T100 public universities, and I thought that I was failure. Not only did I think that I'd never be someone *important*, I was convinced that if I went to a public school I wouldn't even be able to get a job.

&#x200B;

God, I want to smack myself. I'm in my senior year of college now and the last three years have been the most amazing years of my life. I know without a doubt I wouldn't have had the same experience had I gotten into my 'dream' school. I wanted share some of my experiences below for those of you that are fixated on certain schools. 

**1)** **If you think it's competitive now, think about what the your dream college will be like**.

During college I've been a part of my school's debate society, which is probably one of the most well-funded and well-respected public debate unions in the country. I wouldn't say the college debate circuit is dominated by Ivies, but certainly Harvard/Yale/Princeton regularly send lots of teams to every tournament. Over the years I got to know a lot of them since we see each other almost every weekend. On the surface, they all seem perfectly content, like debating 30+ hrs a week on top of a rigorous courseload comes easily to them. Many (not all) of the people I've talked to are deeply unhappy.

Seriously, think about it. If you go to an Ivy/T20, you're among the best, if not \*the\* best at your school. You eat, breathe and sleep getting into \*this\* college, because goddammit you're *special*. You're not like any of the other chumps who took it easy their junior year, those losers who aren't doing 3+ extracurriculars at a state or national level, because you're *driven* and *going somewhere.* Probably your entire life you've been the brightest in your class, and you get a lot of validation from that. 

And when you finally get to this college, you're the norm. Average. Honestly, for most of us, probably below average, or at least that's how you'll perceive yourself. There is always someone with more money, more connections, more national or international awards, more *oh my god you're taking differential equations as a freshman?* 

And this is where the competition really starts. Competition for finance internships, for campaign staffing, for professor recommendations, for spots on the \*D team\* in your college's debate society (yes, even if you went to ToC). 

I don't want to hammer this point home too much. My friends at Ivies constantly talk about how competitive it is just to join an extracurricular, the feeling of always being inadequate, the sometimes shallow friendships and transparent social-climbing. And? You still have to compete with people from every other university in the country for the 'good jobs' that you were promised by this institution. 

I'm not saying that being under pressure isn't valuable, or that everyone who goes to these schools are deeply unhappy. But for me, going to a university where there wasn't cutthroat competition just to join extracurriculars let me shop around and join things I never thought I would. I felt like I had the latitude to experiment and grow as a person because I was surrounded with friends and professors who genuinely wanted that for me, not waiting to put me down so they had the feeling of getting an edge. 

**2)** **Don't get into debt.**

School is f\*cking expensive. It's absolutely ridiculous to be just starting out in life and have $100k+ of student loan debt hanging over your head. *Go wherever gives you the most money*. People say that (most) high schoolers have no conception of money and that it's criminal to lure them into thousands of dollars of debt. As a high schooler, I was convinced that \*I\* knew what I was getting into, and that I would willingly pay any price to go to a ""good"" school, because of course it would pay off.

It's golden handcuffs. When you know you're graduating with debt, the pressure to get a good job skyrockets. No summer to go backpacking with your friends in Europe, you *need* that finance bootcamp so you can work at Goldman Sachs next summer. Going to the bars or a party with your friends? No, the stochastic calculus and corporate finance classes you took requires at least 20 hours a week studying. Can't risk graduating with anything below a 3.8 if you want a finance job. And doing the bare minimum at these jobs once you graduate means working 80 hours a week, minimum. For years. Until that debt is paid.

More importantly, unless you are literally trying to work for Goldman right out of college, I promise you it matters less and less where you go to school because employers do realize how expensive school is. Internships at boutique finance firms aren't hard to come by and they really don't care what school you go to, and once you have work experience you're golden. Look at the list of schools Harvard and Yale Law accept students from; it's mostly public state universities. 

**3) Be a big fish in a small pond, if that's what you really want to do.** 

If you really are Ivy material, and you really do think that you're better than 95% of other students, go to a state school. Think about getting a stellar recommendation from a professor at an R1 (high research) university, vs. competing with *everyone* in your upper-level econ class for a tepid recommendation letter, or not one at all. Think about less competition for research assistant positions, leadership opportunities, conference travel funding. If you're a grad school admissions committee, which looks better? 

Most importantly, college will be what you make of it. The name on your school, most likely, will not hold you back from anything that you want to do unless you let it. And if it did, I can tell you from experience, these fancy jobs/internships aren't worth it in the end. Think about what you really want out of life. If the only thing keeping you going is the validation you get from the name on your diploma, seriously reevaluate your life. The competition for external validation doesn't end when you get to an elite college, **it only gets more intense.** ",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/9qfjl5/a_little_bit_of_perspective_from_a_21_yo_college/,2182,Basically you're disappointed you aren't a big fish in a small pond anymore? ,2018-10-22 16:41:34

192,g37nsu,False,Best of A2C,76,"My personal system for easily creating fun, original essay topics. Introducing: ""Half-Ideas""",ApplyingToCollege," In my experience, the majority of problems students run into with their application essays are based upon picking a bad topic. By ""bad"" I generally mean the topic falls into two categories:

1) Done to death

2) Too weird for its own good

The first one I can easily provide samples for: probably my most common one is running track. A lot of students run track and want to write about their experiences. That's great except that a lot of other students also run track and have similar things to say. There are only so many ways to write about track - see if you recognize any of these classics:

\- I joined track and was bad at it, but then I tried harder and now I'm good

\- I'm really good at track and here is a list of my accomplishments you already saw on my EC that prove how good I am

\- I'm just ok at track, but through the team, I have gained other skills like leadership that are important to me

\- I loved running track until something made it so I couldn’t anymore. But then I got better and now I can again

\- I loved running track until something made it so I couldn’t anymore. And I still can’t. But it’s ok I figured it out

\- I don't actually like track, but in being forced to do it, I learned some valuable lessons

\- Here is a live recap of me running the anchor on the 400 relay, with every student I pass symbolizing an obstacle I have conquered in life to get where I am

That last one is a bit of a joke. But it's indicative of the problem that I think drives elite students to get so...creative in the framing devices on their essays. You students know track isn't that special, but it is something important to you, and you want to talk about it. The end result is...well…

[https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fy37s9/i\_think\_modern\_elite\_essays\_are\_terrible\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fy37s9/i_think_modern_elite_essays_are_terrible_and/)

And then the other problem is with ""le quirky teen"" essays. These never seem to work out as well as anyone wants. That penguin collection may be as important to you as you write about, but without anything more substantial to link those interests to, the essay falls apart.

So, what do we do about all this? How do we manage to write about what matters to us, but in a way that's still fun and original? 

The answer is *half-ideas*.

""I like track because it taught me responsibility"" is a half idea. So is ""I have trouble sleeping when I'm nervous. So is ""I collect stuffed penguins."" So is ""I like making people laugh and try to lighten the mood when things are hard."" A half idea is anything about you or your world that you think colleges should know about. What makes half-ideas different from normal ideas is that we want to come up with these ideas with the full intention of *combing those ideas together to create an original topic.*

Some people stumble upon combining half ideas by accident. I did! I wrote an essay ten years ago that perfectly encapsulated how easy and powerful combing two ideas can be. My two half ideas for the topic were:

1. I have ADHD
2. I like to run 

Either of these topics could be converted into a competent, if unexciting, essay on their own. I guarantee AOs will read hundreds of similar essays this year.  But luck would have it, I combined those two half ideas into a full idea that worked a lot better. All I had to do was look at those two topics and try to find a connection between them. I've found that the best connections will pop out to you. Mine did:

**How running helps me deal with my ADHD by giving me a way to quiet my mind and think clearly** 

The hardest part of my ADHD is getting my brain to stop moving so fast. As quickly as I start to think about something important, that thought gets batted away by garbage. I like running because I find when I get tired enough, my brain will quiet down, and I can think about things that are important or bothering me. I get most of my best thinking done six miles into a run. That's my essay. 

I guarantee there aren't many students writing that essay. By combing two ideas into a single one, I make the topic much more personal and unique. I also build myself a natural narrative structure by both presenting a challenge and a way I conquer that challenge. ""How X helps me with Y"" is a great way to frame an essay  Cool, right!

So let's get practical. The first step is to build as many half-ideas as possible. Just start posting as many ideas as you can. Don't worry about how you'll match them or if they're even worth matching. You've likely heard similar ""just write; it doesn't matter what!"" advice before, but I think that advice kind of sucks because it DOES matter what you write. With half-ideas, you should feel more comfortable posting weird factoids about yourself because you'll no longer have to worry about turning those ideas in a full essay. Just write them. Here are some sample list groups you can start with, along with as many personal half ideas I can think of for each.

**Cool stuff you've done that would make a traditional essay**

4 years Cross Country

3 Years Track

2 Years School Newspaper

4 years Parli Debate

Hosted a school zombie tag game

Active non-fiction writer

Started my own College Consulting business and made a sweet website, nbd (CollegeWithMattie.com)

**Obstacles you've overcome** 

ADHD

I suffered through chronic illness in my 20s

Colorblind

**Weird ""quirky"" facts about you**

I love cats and have one named Penny

I love football and refuse to work on Sunday

I taught myself piano using a video game

**Positive Personality Traits**

My mom says I'm funny

I'm easy to talk to and once won a bet by speaking about my cat and college admissions for 3 hours straight

I think differently and often come up with solutions for problems no one else has (like this one!)

I see patterns well and am always looking for a more efficient way to do things

**Goals/Passions/Proof of those passions**

Want to be a private college admissions consultant

Finishing UC Berkeley certification on topic

Worked past three years as a counselor with company

10 years of writing experience

&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;

That's just a short selection. Locate any ""idea suggestion"" posts and you will find more topics to think about. 

Now that I have my list, it's time for me to look for connections between the two. Often the best value for this method comes when one of the half ideas is from the ""challenges/hardships"" section. This is especially true for URM or any other student with a background hook. You want to present that background but do it in a way that's more tasteful than ""I grew up X, and here's why it was hard."" Combine that half idea with another interest of yours, so the topic becomes ""How Y helped me overcome my Childhood as X"". Yay half ideas!

When looking at my list, two ideas that come to mind are my history of illness + that I taught myself piano. I decided to teach myself piano two years ago as a way of signifying that my life was going to be different now that I was better. It turned out that way, and now I celebrate my piano playing as a symbol of the fact that life doesn't take things from me anymore; I gain from it.

Pretty good topic, ya? Seeing these topics all out in front of me made it easy to compare them to one another and see what kind of connections I could identify. 

Here are some bonus tips as you develop your half-idea stable:

**Your ideas don't have to share 50/50 content.** 

Sometimes one topic is just more interesting than the other. Don't be afraid for a single idea to encompass 80%+ of an essay, with another idea coming in as support. Maybe you write about charity work and realize that every time you read to a kid in the hospital you leave him with one of your stuffed penguins. That's exactly why you want to introduce those penguins earlier so you can add it to your experience.

**You can even have third ideas. Whatever**

Going back to my illness/piano essay, I'd probably also want to add my wish to be a counselor in near the end. Just as I gained piano in my life, I also want to obtain success in counseling. Seeeee? It's so fun and eaaaaaasy!

**Focus on the interaction between the ideas as much as or more than the ideas themselves**

Somewhere out there is another essay involving both a love of swimming and a keen interest in robotics. Simply having two half-ideas existing in an essay is not necessarily going to make it work. Instead, I find it’s the way those ideas intertwine -the connection itself- that is most interesting. I think it’s because that connection entirely relies on you and how you view the world. That’s where the magic happens. 


**Keep every half-idea about you**

This goes into advice for another blog post, but keep the focus of your essays on you. Your friends, family, famous people, politicians, and everyone else can cameo in your story, but the vast majority of content needs to be about you. The easiest way to ensure this is to keep all half-ideas that way from the start.

**You can think of half-ideas retroactively**

Write something and just feel like it's missing something? Think hard about other aspects of your life that may fit into the essay you've already written. Maybe you wrote about a big camping trip. You can bring up the fact that you're always the one who tries to keep the group calm, so when things were rough, you took it upon yourself to provide moral support. The goal is writing an essay that showcases what happens when different aspects of your life come together.

**Try to form your full topics in the form of a narrative**

Utilizing ""how"" is a great way to do this. How my love for paper airplanes made me a better engineer. How my daily NYT crossword puzzle influences my taste in authors. Get both topics in there and try to present one as having a causal effect on the other.

**Don't go insane**

You may have a topic or two that are awesome and don't need tinking with. Don't! This may be advice for essays 2-27 you'll be writing. Keep the list of half-ideas handy and constantly be adding to it. You never know when you'll be inspired by it.

196,fuzm72,False,Rant,116,UNPOPULAR OPINION : Being accepted to a T20 doesn't make you an expert on college admissions,ApplyingToCollege,"Title is basically self-explanatory. I have followed the whole stat video/college reaction video genre for a while and though I believe they are largely unhealthy (story for a different time), I felt that in the past these had a decent amount of good information. Recently, however, this category of ""influencers"" has exploded. Especially with platforms like Tik Tok and Youtube, it seems quite literally everyone who gets into an Ivy+ has the ""SECRET FORMULA ON HOW TO GET INTO A T20!!!"" Here are some of my favorite soundbites...


**""What really got me into x university was...""** - You literally have NOTHING to back this statement up. Unless you talked to your admission officer personally, you do not have any clue as to what got you into the university you chose. It is misleading and disingenuous to talk as though you have some secret insight into what made your application special. It is even worse when said person has a 1600 SAT and 2-gen legacy, and they then go on to say that their 300 word supplemental about learning how to swim is what got them into Stanford. Are you kidding?

**""What really matters is having good essays and extracurriculars!""** - I completely agree with this point. The problem is who doesn't already know this? Who are the kids who think that academics are literally everything? You look up one guide on college admissions and it is probably the first thing on the list. Why do people think it is such a secret that you should ""focus on your extracurriculars!""?

**""I got into x school with a 25th percentile SAT, so you can too!""** - This just isn't true, and is one of my biggest gripes. It seems that these influencers want to think that college admission is this 100% holistic process and test scores are just some red herring. It usually turns out that said vlogger either has an extremely extenuating background or S-tier extracurriculars. If you think that you can get into an Ivy with a 1210 because you ""write nice,"" I have bad news. Statistics don't lie. For everyone with a 25th percentile SAT, there are 3 other people at the same universities with a better score. 

More and more it seems like these admission-influencers are really not so much interested in actually helping and more so interested in bragging about their achievements (HOW I GOT INTO HARVARD PART 1????) and spouting meaningless talking points they have heard from others. These types of vids used to be so beneficial but now it seems every video sounds the same. Literally. Turn on two of your stereotypical ""HOW I GOT INTO X UNIVERSITY"" videos right now. Tell me their points aren't identical. I'll summarize it right now: ""Start your ~unique~ essays early. Have continuity in your application. Find something you are passionate about and pursue it. Demonstrate interest in your school."" That is it.

 It is so sad to see people who go to truly amazing universities produce content that is so blatantly braggadocious and above all completely unimaginative. It is even more sad to think that kids who don't know better will follow this often misleading advice and start idolizing ivies for no other reason than a cool name.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fuzm72/unpopular_opinion_being_accepted_to_a_t20_doesnt/,2169,Lol I didn’t read ur post and I’m kinda stoned but I do have my admittance to Stanford last year. Tbh idk why I’m still on this sub but the truth is I spent so much time being a good student and the SATs because the odds were stacked against me. Being an asian applying to elite schools from the Bay Area is tough but it was tougher that my parents didn’t go to college and I didn’t grow up with elite resources. I only needed the determination and grit to try my hardest. I guess what I’m saying is that some people are only at t20s because their parents are legacy or like they’re just wealthy and by extension quite clever and smart. ,2020-04-04 19:23:38

222,fp1o6k,False,Shitpost Wednesdays,43,BREAKING NEWS: Northeastern University decides to just not do decisions this year,ApplyingToCollege,"In a truly unprecedented move, Northeastern University has decided to not bother finishing to read their remaining Regular Decision applications and revoke admission from all those accepted in the early rounds.

""We deeply regret to inform all our potential applicants that we will no longer be able to send them short, impersonal letters this year."" noted Assistant Dean of Admissions Stefanie Kane. ""It was lots of fun sending them confusing and vague emails about our decision date, though. The funniest part? We weren't releasing decisions in the first place this year!"" Kane also scoffed at the idea of institutional oversight and transparency. ""We only hope our decisions release process is as nonsensical and sporadic as the University of Michigan's. The website crash in January simply wasn't enough."" 

Experts suggest that the move may have been an effort by Northeastern to manage their yield and US News ranking. ""If you don't accept anyone, your yield rate automatically rises to 100%."" noted many high school seniors disguised as college admissions experts.

I am a Christian and I go to church and I'm even a preacher's kid. But when you're a black student who transferred from public school at a majority white school with some pretty racist students who all share the exact same ideologies without room for debate, you kind of don't want to spend any more time in such an environment if you can help it. I have nothing against Christian universities or their student bodies, but my top schools, even lower-ranked schools like MI State, Wayne State, and Ohio State (my dad lives in OH) have better programs than what the others are offering.

My dad doesn't want to pay? Cool.

USC is offering free tuition bro. Lol.

&#x200B;

\[edit\] This feels like one of those celebrity apology tweets: Background: USC is a school that offers free tuition for families with income under 80k. Yes, as many have pointed out, **I am a current junior/rising senior.** The point of this was not to mislead anyone into thinking I have 1.) been accepted into USC or 2.) that I have a full-ride for some reason or another. My stats put me at a high chance of acceptance (yes I know that nothing is certain, but statistically speaking) and *if/when* I get in, I will qualify for free tuition. The point of this post was to rant (hence the flair) about how my dad was essentially withholding tuition money if I don't attend a certain type of university, but how I didn't really care because most schools I'm applying to will apply varying amounts of free aid, so it didn't matter if he paid or not, any amount remaining, if at all (such as with USC), can be taken care of by me personally or smaller loans because I wouldn't be paying full tuition regardless.

I worded some things vaguely and unclearly, that's my bad. Alright, have a blessed day :)

I haven't received an interview from my ED school yet, but it's really important that the school gets to see me as a human being, rather than grades and an essay. I just designed an online invitation to my birthday party, and I'm thinking I should invite my regional admissions counselor.

Since I didn't get an interview, I think hosting Mr. Admissions Officer at my Excellent Eighteen would provide a plethora of opportunities for him to get to know me:

* I have prepared the following playlist:
   * ""Two Phones"" by Kevin Gates as a metaphor for my ability to balance my academic and social lives.
   * ""X Gon' Give It To Ya"" by DMX to warn Mr. Admissions Officer that rejecting my application with an ""X"" would put his well-being in peril.
   * ""Thrift Shop"" by Macklemore to highlight my fiscal responsibility and natural potential as an Economics major.
   * ""F\*ck Up Some Commas"" by Future to apologize for minor grammatical errors in my supplements.
   * ""E.T."" by Katy Perry and Kanye West to indicate my interest in pursuing a minor in Aerospace Engineering.
* I will serve food and drinks exclusively of the schools colors as an implicit claim that I am a clear fit for the college.
* I have designed posters to hang in my basement bearing phrases, which clarify that academics are *always* a priority:
   * ""Less drinking, more thinking.""
   * ""No Juuls. Joules only (1 joule = 1kgm\^2/s\^2)""
   * ""Don't drink and derive.""
* I am inviting 6% of my grade to my Excellent Eighteen to make the environment more comfortable for Mr. Admissions Officer, as he tends to invite around 6% of applicants to the school.
* I will provide some grant-based financial aid for Mr. Admissions Officer's travel expenses to and from my house, if he chooses to fax his 2017 Federal Tax Return and 2017 W-2 forms by November 15th.

&#x200B;

So my parents have never been supportive of my college education. I got into a university that was really nice during my senior year of high school, and they didn't want me going there at all. I was only 17 at the time, so I didn't have the option to take out loans without a cosigner, and my parents refused. So .. I had to turn down the offer and start at my local community college. The only positive to this was that I got to go for free lol.

I'm at community college now, and I applied to several schools crossing my fingers that I would get in. I worked my ass off to make sure that I didn't get anything less than an A in all of my classes. I also got a credit card to establish a credit history for myself so that I could be eligible to take out loans (if I need to) for university. My parents think that I will be doing the nursing program at my community college, but I will really be transferring to a university. I had to lie to my parents about why I had to have a credit card because they got suspicious.

Fast forward a couple months later, I received the acceptance letter that changed everything. My top university accepted me into their nursing program. I could not believe it. In my eyes, I was just an average student, and I doubted that I would have got in, but I did. I also ended up getting a scholarship that covers all of my tuition and books. I would only need to get loans for the dorm. I know that people say that ""loans are the devil"" and everything, but this is an investment for my education, and I know it will pay off in the end.

My parents do not know that I got into this university nor do they know that I am planning on leaving. I know 110% that they would not support me going, and may even do everything that they can to stop me. I will leave when my parents aren't home and get a ride/bus to the university on moving day. I do feel kind of bad about doing this, but I do hope that they will understand why I did this with time.

I'm posting this for all of those people who have no support from anyone with trying to get your education. It's not easy at all, and there were several times where I felt like giving up, but you can do it.

261,fhgumf,False,None,116,How Coronavirus Might Impact Admissions: a post by a former UChicago/Berkeley admissions reader,ApplyingToCollege,"Many of you might *not* know me, as life circumstances led me to being pretty dormant on Reddit this past admissions cycle (sorry about that). But I'm Marcella (also known as Novembrr), a former admissions reader at UChicago and Berkeley's Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology program, and a college admissions consultant.

Naturally, I think many of you are worrying about how coronavirus might impact college admissions. I don't know for certain, as nothing is known for certain right now, but here are some of my thoughts.

[Here's a list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19wJZekxpewDQmApULkvZRBpBwcnd5gZlZF2SEU2WQD8/htmlview) of all universities closed at the moment. 

**For high school seniors and other applicants awaiting decisions:**

* Early to mid March is the season for admissions committee meetings. With universities closing their doors, it is probable that some universities' committee meetings were impacted, and I imagine many continued to work online. It is possible that some universities will be late in releasing admissions decisions this year. I am part of numerous online channels for admissions professionals, and have heard no official word regarding postponed decision dates. Be prepared for them to happen, however; if they do, I imagine the May 1st deposit date could get pushed back. Note: See comments for more opinions/details.

* As you all know, admitted student days are being cancelled or taken online. You can also find virtual tours on [CampusReel](https://www.campusreel.org/). If you do not have access to the internet at home, and thereby cannot make an educated decision about where you will attend college, consider reaching out to the co-leaders of the National Association for College Admission Counseling's [rural and small town special interest group](https://www.nacacnet.org/about/SIGs/rural-and-small-town/). Andrew Moe of Swarthmore is leading an initiative to share information with students offline. Even if you aren't from a rural area but are otherwise impacted by a lack of internet access, please contact Andrew. You could alternatively reach out to the leaders of the [special interest group](https://www.nacacnet.org/about/SIGs/) with which you most closely align to ask for help. I also know the irony of telling you to email someone about your lack of internet access :/

* If your family cannot afford to make a deposit to a university due to economic strain as a result of Covid-19 (or any other reason, for that matter), email the university to outline your family's circumstances and ask for an extension on the deposit deadline or reduction in deposit amount. 

* If your grades suffer during this time (because of illness, financial instability, stress, etc.) and you are worried about being rescinded, write an email to the universities to which you're considering depositing (after you've been admitted) and provide them with context into your situation. No, this is not my permission to slack off, but don't overly stress about a situation that is outside your control.

* AP exams might be cancelled, which can unfortunately impact course credit in college. If your exam is cancelled, consider a) asking for a refund on any $ paid to College Board to register for those exams, and b) reaching out to the university at which you enroll to see if your grade in the class will confer any credit, in lieu of the AP exam score. 

**For younger students:**

* You can check for SAT test site cancellations [here](https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/register/test-center-closings). This list is slow to update, so please check individually with your test center. 

* Do not panic if your SAT is cancelled; my hunch is more and more schools will go test optional in the year or two to come to accommodate for students impacted by Covid-19 test cancellations. At the very least, you can write an additional information statement on your college apps that outline how your test results were impacted by Covid-19. 

* As a safeguard, I recommend that juniors (without test scores OR with test scores lower than their goal) investigate [this list of test optional universities](https://www.fairtest.org/university/optional) and add at least one to their college lists.

* Do not stress about visiting colleges to demonstrate interest. You can investigate whether a university even considers demonstrated interest in the admissions process by looking at their [common data set](https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/wiki/common_data_sets). Once you're in a university's common data set, control + F for ""Level of applicant’s interest"" and you'll have your answer as to whether or not they even factor it into admissions decisions. Keep in mind, too, that there are other ways to demonstrate interest! Some colleagues at College Coach wrote this [helpful guide](https://blog.getintocollege.com/coronavirus-and-college-admissions-demonstrating-interest-without-visiting-campus/). At the very least, you can write an additional information statement for the university in question, describing how your plans to visit campus had to be cancelled. 

* You can check out the aforementioned CampusReel for campus tours, but many universities have announced that they are working on recording their own virtual tours and information sessions online, so check universities' admissions websites regularly for those resources. I've also heard that some universities are doing regular Zoom/Facebook Live info session/Q&As, so consider registering for something virtual. 

* Be prepared for summer programs to be cancelled. If they are, if you remain quarantined through the summer, or if you cannot or will not pay for expensive summer programs, consider taking free online courses through Coursera, EdX, MIT's OpenCourseware and other online sources. Reading, tinkering with electronics, perfecting a hobby, etc. are all reasonable summer activities. 

* If you were selected to compete in some prestigious competition or attend some special program or event, and can no longer do so, you can include in your honors/awards section on college apps that you were selected/nominated for the award/competition/event, and/or provide that information in an additional information statement. 

* AP exams might be cancelled. If they are, and aren't rescheduled for a later date this calendar year, consider signing up to take the exam *next* year. Like mentioned above, when you ultimately deposit to attend a university, you can also contact them to see if your grade in the AP class can confer credit. Would also be worth mentioning in your additional info statement in college applications that you were unable to take the official exam but practice exams had you scoring XYZ.

* For international applicants, the TOEFL might be headed [online, at home](https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2020/03/10/ets-plans-toefl-home-coronavirus-affected-countries).

* Unfortunately, colleges might take massive hits to their budgets and could rebound by seeking to fill incoming classes with more full-pay applicants. If you can pay in full, great. If you can't, consider broadening your list to include need blind institutions and universities with higher acceptance rates at which you will qualify for large scholarships. My colleague over at My Kid's College Choice sells a [list of merit-based scholarships](https://www.mykidscollegechoice.com/full-scholarship-list/) at universities. I don't know her personally, but I've seen the list and it's fantastic.

**And for students in college/transfer applicants:**

* If classes are cancelled, dorms are closed, and you are unable to go home (you are an international student, you cannot afford to return home, home is not a safe place for you, etc.), please consider reaching out to your alumni association. Many alumni are rallying around current students to offer temporary housing, rides, food, storage, etc.

* If you applied to transfer and your mid-term grade reports are impacted by college closings, please contact the institutions to which you applied to ask for extensions/alternate options. If you have to return abroad, your timezone conflicts with the timezone in which your classes are offered online, and your grades suffer as a result, write a short extenuating circumstances essay and share that with those institutions, as well. On my online channels, I've seen multiple institutions pledge to accommodate transfer applicants.

* Updated to add: I just heard that the U.S. Student and Exchange Visitor Program has determined that, for students on F-1 visas, having to head home due to your university's closure will not be considered a violation of your F-1 visa. When the university resumes face-to-face classes, all F-1 students will be expected to return to classes. Please double check that information, as it's new to me!

**Final thoughts**:

I will try to update this post as I see more information come in regarding how Covid-19 will impact applicants and colleges. If I find any of this information to be outdated or incorrect, I'll delete those instances. 

At the end of the day, I want you to stay safe and healthy; avoid situations that will put you, your family, friends or neighbors in harm's way; and avoid stressing about situations out of your control. As the parent of a medically-fragile kid, I worry about what's to come for our families and my heart aches for those already impacted.

264,fs5903,False,Serious,63,I was rejected by every college I applied to last year (except for a safety). Here is my story.,ApplyingToCollege,"This is a bit long but I hope you read all of it if you need encouragement.

DISCLAIMER: I did this in a rush so my grammar isn't spot on and I hope religious indifferences don't stop you from encouragement. There is so much more to my story but to keep things simple, I've cut out a lot of detail. I am also not one of those students who didn't have any extra-curricular activities. 

It is December 2013 and the Christmas spirit is felt throughout Seoul, South Korea. Festive lights glitter and Korean covers of Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas Is You” echo throughout the snowy winter night. The streets are empty as everybody is home getting ready to go to bed. I witnessed this Christmas ghost town shivering on a park bench. My mother had just kicked me out of the house. Tears froze on my 7th-grade cheeks as I cried myself to sleep. I was too young to realize that my mother’s irrational punishments were due to her scapegoating her stress on me. I wouldn’t stay out for more than one night as my mother would always eventually let me back in. But coming back home wasn’t safe either. I faced physical and emotional abuse from my hot-tempered father. In bursts of anger, he would punch my face, kick me against walls, and put me in chokeholds. His favorite thing to say to me was that my dog was more important to the family than me. That year, I attempted suicide 7 times. I tried poisoning myself with shampoo, hanging myself, holding a knife to my chest, but I could never commit all the way because I was scared to go to hell. I prayed to God for guidance and he provided a way. My path was to devote my life to school so that a good college would want me and I could establish a bright future without the need of my parents. I held this goal every single day. I was determined.

I moved back to California for high school but that didn’t change anything about my life. I still faced abuse from my parents but I continued to hold onto my goal. Whenever I would get physically and emotionally abused, I would cry to sleep until my parents went to bed. I would then do my homework all night in peace. Whenever I would get kicked out of the house, I would immediately go to the library to study and spend my nights at a friend’s house(Fun fact: I spent my finals week during my sophomore year sleeping on my friend's couch). My classmates would tease me and call me “depresso boy” but I stayed strong and focused. I didn’t get a car until the last week of my junior year so I commuted everywhere on the public bus. I used my hour commutes to continue to study. I never had an allowance from my parents so I hustled on the side to financially support myself. I stayed determined and it showed through my good grades.

But things took a huge turn during my junior year. I gave my parents a second chance and called them out for their harassment of me in hopes of reconciliation. My mother broke down and apologized but my father called my feelings a joke. That is when my parents decided to go through a divorce. Throughout my junior year, my father put the blame on me for a broken family and told me to give up on my college dream because I wouldn't be receiving any financial support from him. This tormented me while I took my ACT. I was on the brink of giving up. The divorce never went through because of family interventions hosted by my extended family. Then one Sunday morning, days before my senior year, I woke up with food poisoning. My father told me that morning to walk my dog in which I said yes. However, I was stuck in the bathroom for 30 min with my illness so my sister unknowingly took my dog out. My father responded by putting me in a headlock and throwing me down the stairs. He then screamed at me to leave the house and never come back. I was fed up with the years of abuse from my father so I finally stood up to him. He, of course, hung me by my hair and started attacking my face. He then finally threw me out. Heartbroken and scared, I called the police for help in which they put me in a hospital and I got assigned a social worker. 

I spent my senior year living with my aunt. Being separated from my family didn’t stop my goal though. I actually performed better at school due to the absence of abuse from my father. I got a 97% or above for all my classes that first semester. At that moment, I thought my life was finally turning around. I was wrong. With a 34 ACT and around a 4.5 GPA, I was rejected from UPenn, USC, UCLA, UC Irvine, UChicago, and NYU. The last college I had to hear from was UC Berkeley, my dream school. It was a Wednesday and my last class was AP Econ. During the last 10 min of class, UC Berkeley released the admissions. I watched 3 students in my class cry with joy as they got accepted. My body shook incredibly as I knew this was my last chance at my 6-year goal. After school, I drove straight to my local church. I got out of my car and walked to the church building. I put my hand on the building wall and began logging into my UC Berkeley portal on my phone. I did one last prayer and then opened my result. I was rejected. I waited to see tears drop onto my screen but it didn’t happen. I stood there, with my hand on the church building, motionless. I remember my whole body was numb and shaking uncontrollably. I didn’t know what to do. All my hard work, all the pain I endured, all the frustration I pushed aside was for nothing. As I finally drove back home, I realized I should just committed suicide when I was 12 years old to save me from 6 years of pain.

I never did commit suicide because I did get accepted into SDSU. After all those rejections, I didn’t feel abandoned by God. I knew I still had a path with SDSU and that this path is for good reasons just like how the pain I endured for all those years has built me into a strong person with incredible grit.  Since I am a CA-resident, I can pay for own tuition with the money I made through my business and loans. 

Don't let college admissions define your life. It is YOU that defines it. If you didn't get into your dream school, move on and set new dreams now. Achieve those dreams so that those colleges that rejected you regret missing out on the amazing person you have become. I believe in you. (When you achieve your dreams, I suggest going into your room and listening to High Hopes by PATD while you shed those joyous tears) Also, don't be envious of those classmates that got in instead of you. Don't think you deserved it more than them. You are bigger than that.

If you got into your dream school, I congratulate you. Nobody deserved that spot more than you because everybody deserves to be happy in life and a chance at success.

268,cezbly,False,Best of A2C,237,5 Most Overdone Essays and How to Avoid Them,ApplyingToCollege,"Hey everyone,

Based on your feedback, it seems like a lot of you are curious about what the most common essay structures are and what are topics to generally avoid for top schools. You know, I’ve always found it fascinating how rapidly the admissions process changes every year, and how behind the general public is at catching up. The essay advice I see online now is about 5-6 years late. It’s 2019, nobody’s writing about dead pets or mission trips to Africa anymore. 

The following represents some of the essays that I have found to be the most overdone ranked from most common to least. One disclaimer I want to make is that essays, while vital, are not the only factor for a student's success. There are also ways to make these work, though I generally tell students not to try since they’re more difficult targets to hit. Lastly, these reflect my own experience, and I’ll bet that another reader in another office might have a different set of essays he/she/they are tired of reading.




**The Most Common Essay Structure, Period**

This essay outline has become the most popular over the past 3-4 years or so. I’m not sure why, but it goes something like this:

1. First standalone sentence that’s supposed to “grab the reader’s attention” I guess. *The electricity in the room was palpable.* 

2. Following that, the first narrative paragraph explaining/revealing the context and situation. *Got it, so you’re at your state debate tournament.*

3. Montage paragraph describing your journey from the beginning to this moment. *You joined your debate team and were elected team captain.*

4. Jumping to the present and wrapping up your story. *Hurray, you won an award and/or placed well.*

5. End with a personal takeaway that doesn’t look any different than the last hundred essays I’ve read about your sport/club/instrument. *You weren’t confident in yourself initially, but now you learned to accept yourself and are thriving as a result. You were scared to be in a new environment, but now you feel comfortable and have assimilated into a new team.*

Now fundamentally this structure makes sense and performed well years ago. It builds suspense, it weaves in and out of time like an action movie. The problem I find is that many of these essays 1) follow this structure exactly with no variation and 2) have nothing of substance to say. It gets tiring. Instead of having exactly this outline, I would recommend that students try to build upon this or use this as a launch pad. 




**First-World “Woe-is-Me” Essays**

Nobody’s writing about dead pets anymore, but the general idea is still showing up. Many middle-class to upper-class students make the focal point of their Common Application about issues they face that a reader is just not going to care about. The larger problem is that students will write about these mundane problems with complete and utter sincerity. Examples include minor maladies or ailments, “financial issues,” difficult teachers etc.

There are two problems with this approach: 

1) You’re operating under the assumption that gaining sympathy from your readers will help you gain an acceptance. This is not going to be true when you are in these social classes. Exceptions do exist, but only for applicants with extreme familial and financial situations. Most of you writing these essays do not originate from such a background.

2) We’re not stupid. Students will often write about financial inconveniences or having a lack of educational resources even though they grew up in a nice, upper-middle class suburb with a solid school system. We can generally tell what your income is based on your activities and we know your region from previous cycles. At best, your reader is confused about your story and background. At worst, they think you’re exaggerating your circumstances.

Generally, writing about difficulties you’ve faced is completely doable as long as you have something interesting to say and can relate to your reader. I just don’t want to read 650 words about how hard it was growing up with braces, especially when millions of children across the globe don’t have access to dental care.




**“Quirky” Essays with No Substance**

I blame all those wacky viral essays on Business Insider (the most useless site ever) or whatever.  

If you ask anyone in this subreddit, everyone “knows” that it is important to be unique and differentiate yourself. What makes you special, what can you bring to campus etc. The problem is that many of these essays tend to focus more on “Hey look at me, I’m different!” rather than having something substantive to say.

The core issue is that students tend to come across as inauthentic. Being genuine and sincere in your essays is one of (if not the most) important things colleges look for, and writing about oatmeal or staplers or some other random object really makes me question whether I like you or not. 

So that’s the logical reason. From my experience, sometimes admissions officers just won’t like you because you come across as plain weird. You might think your Hearthstone Twitch channel or yo-yo skills are cool, but a lot of readers just won’t care.




**Tragedy**

Unfortunately, tragedy is very common. I’ve read hundreds of essays about friends’ suicides, parental deaths, abuse, bullying, assault etc. The issue from an admissions perspective is that 1) there are so many similar ones that it’s difficult to differentiate you from others in the pool 2) generally, you spend the entire essay talking about other people rather than yourself 3) students often have nothing new or innovative to say about said tragedy. I know this is unfortunate, but this is just the nature of seeing these essays year after year for a long period of time. People don’t care about sob stories anymore on American Idol either. 

Personally, I think that tragedy, if included, should not be the focal point of your essay. Weave it into a larger structure, and make it more about yourself and how the circumstances you faced have changed your perspective. Plenty of students nail this part and perform very well in the overall process as a result. 




**Food/Recipe essays**

There’s two common food essays I’ll see:

1) Metaphor using a particular recipe (lasagna, dumplings etc.) to highlight an applicant’s different qualities through layers or steps. This one’s more common, and just lazy at this point. 

2) Recipe or special food that has been passed down in the applicant’s family (usually grandparents) through cooking together

This surprised me when I first started reading applications, but it makes sense—regardless of culture or class, everyone loves food. 



Lastly, a lot of you have asked me about the Costco essay that “got” a student into 5 Ivies. Look, if you are not also a Hispanic + African-American applicant like her, then I would not consider the essays or resumes of those who are as an appropriate resource. Use previous applicants to your advantage only when they match your own profile. Personally, I thought the essay was a fun read, somewhat refreshing albeit a little insincere and flowery, and would not consider it in the top tier of essays I’ve read. 



Anyways, hope this was helpful. I really liked a few of the other suggestions (what exactly does “fit” mean at an elite school AO, common myths etc.) and really wish I could include everything.

290,b11h76,False,None,169,I just got a full ride and I'm stunned,ApplyingToCollege,"Going into this, I knew I fell into the awkward bracket of ""too poor to pay for college comfortably but too rich to recieve any good financial aid."" I was already terrified of the $100,000+ student loan debt horror stories.  Matters were made worse by the fact that I wanted to become a Veterinarian. I did the math of state college + state vet school, and was looking at potentially $300,000 worth of debt by the time I was 30. 

So I obsessively applied to colleges. I was desperate. In the end, I think I applied to around 40. State schools. Private schools with good financial aid programs. Literally every. single. school. that emailed me offering a free application. I was writing supplementals during my lunch period and waking up at 4am to revise. It consumed almost every moment of my first semester. 

On top of this, I was also applying to full ride scholarships. Literally any and all that were available. By the end of January, I'd written around 65 essays. 

I've been accepted into 25 so far. Decent scholarships, but not enough to graduate debt free, which was my ultimate goal. On the other end of the spectrum, I was rejected from every full ride I applied too. Except one.
 
I had to fly to another state for an interview, conpeting against 100 other finalists. Here's where I started to panic. I'm autistic. Wasn't diagnosed until the second semester of junior year, but it's very obvious when you speak to me that something's off. I'd read the interview advice tips, practiced mock-interviews, but after I interviewed I was convinced I'd bombed it. I was too robotic/soft-spoken/antsy, didn't make enough eye contact, weirded them out, etc, while everyone else seemed so charming and funny and naturally well-spoken. I had no chance. 

And I got the phone call today. All four years, full-tuition paid. For once in my life, I didn't screw up. I did it. I fucking did it. My future is mine to mess up, and I couldn't be happier. 

A special thank you to this sub for all the advice I found lurking. I  hope all of your college acceptance dreams come true <33

304,f148vp,False,None,133,Extremely inappropriate interviewer,ApplyingToCollege,"Sorry if this post comes off like word vomit but I need to get this off my chest because I haven’t told anyone about it yet. I had my Dartmouth interview a couple days ago with a man who was probably 50 years older than me and he was being really inappropriate the entire time. We met in a Starbucks. He complimented me multiple times on my outfit, jewelry, hair, and was very insistent on telling me about the social scene at Dartmouth. I would try to ask about academics or atmosphere and he would steer the conversation back to what the dating scene was like there. He told me to “stay safe at frat parties because God knows what those boys would do to a girl like you.” He asked me if I was part Asian and when I said yes he said his girlfriend during his junior year was Asian. During the interview, he would put his hand on my knee/thigh and keep it there for a minute. He was also constantly staring at my chest. When it was finally over he said he wanted to walk me back to my car and I said that’s okay I need to use the bathroom and he said he would wait for me. I didn’t want him to say I was rude on his review of me so I just washed my hands and let him walk me to my car with his hand on my lower back the whole time. 

The entire time I just felt like he was too close to me, he was practically breathing down my neck at one point. He wouldn’t stop touching me even though I would shrink away from it, and he wouldn’t answer any of my questions. After I saw him drive away I just sat in my car and cried for a while. I don’t know if I can explicitly say it was harassment because I never told him to stop touching me or to stop looking at my breasts but I still feel so disgusting knowing he was looking at me like I’m just a slab of meat. 

He knows my name, email, and my phone number and probably lots of other information about me. At multiple times throughout the interview he said he was good friends with lots of people in the admissions office so I’m scared he’s gonna say something bad about me if I report it. I also just want it to be over, I don’t ever want to have to see him or talk about him again. I have no proof that he was harassing me. I feel like if I report it they’re gonna ask for proof which I don’t have, or they’re going to ask me what I was wearing, or just ignore me. I don’t know what to do and I’m getting really upset again thinking about it. Have any other girls had a similar experience? Boys, too?

Edit: I’ve sent an email with help from u/ScholarGrade and others. Thank you all for the encouraging me to say something and if this happens to you you should as well. Sometimes it’s hard to remember your principles when you’re caught in an uncomfortable situation, but there is nothing wrong with asking someone to stop touching you.

307,dsz86s,False,Interviews,109,Tips from a Stanford Interviewer. Answer these and you'll be prepared for any college interview.,ApplyingToCollege,"This is what I tell my kids that I  interview each year. And I'm very forthcoming with them from the initial  phone call/text/communication of the ""questions"" that I ask. They're  not really questions but they are objectives.

Tell me about your background and what you're interested in studying.

(I  personally don't care about why Stanford because you wrote about that  on your app presumably. Most interviewers will care so you need to have a  very solid, specific answer to that which goes beyond the academics but  gets into fit more than anything else.)

Tell  me what's not on your application that you want to share with the  admissions staff. This is your last shot to communicate with them so  make it count. Tell me about additional context or more detail on your  accomplishments or weaknesses. Family circumstances, health issues,  mental health crises, anything. I want it all and the kitchen sink because this is  the gold that helps make you more human to the admissions committee.  This is where we spend most of the time. In my interviews it is 50% of  the interview. We both brainstorm what else we want to add to strengthen  your app.

What are your questions  about Stanford? I tell them that I only answer questions that aren't  googlable so don't be offended if I shoot your question down just move  on to another one. Hint: asking me questions that involve my opinion or  make me think a little bit are useful.

So  I tell my kids everything I've written above to you. Total  transparency. I don't want to know your stats but I do ask where else  you apply because I give them feedback on the culture of those schools  and whether they think it's a fit for them.

I'm  not the norm but I am one of the university's most experienced  interviewers and I have developed my own method that works well for me  and adds something to the application. I hope that others in the future  will follow suit with the transparency aspect.

If  you can answer these confidently you'll be prepared for any college interview.

I  go into it with the attitude of being your advocate rather than another  person to judge you. I want to share my experience and help you as much  as I possibly can and I often stay in touch with my kids forever  regardless of the outcome. 

Please comment with any questions or PM me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/dsz86s/tips_from_a_stanford_interviewer_answer_these_and/,1788,"I understand that there is a key basis in preparing for an interview with going so far as to pre-write possible responses, but I'm not so convinced that's the way to go. Sure, you should prep yourself for possible questions by thinking on it and maybe brainstorming your response, but wouldn't it be better to set aside all notes during the interview and just talk? I think that would humanize the applicant a great deal more than reading off a script. Also, do you think that's something I could do? It's not that I'm trying to skimp on work, I just don't have a lot of confidence in my ability to stand out otherwise. ",2019-11-07 15:24:09

322,gmdryc,False,Discussion,140,TRULY UNPOPULAR OPINION : Online APs are a Necessary Evil,ApplyingToCollege,"On this sub, it appears the general sentiment is that College Board is some giant scam that purposely created an unfair online test-taking experience. While some of this is true (I certainly disagree with College Board's status as a monopoly and supposed ""non-profit""), there are certain parts that I think are just completely false. Here are some of my points...

**1. THERE IS NO EASY ANSWER TO THE CURRENT TESTING SITUATION**

While I understand it is frustrating, I believe it is important to think about the predicament that College Board is in. They must create a standardized test that all universities can trust as a method to gauge course understanding, as well as assuring that this test is accessible and achievable for the average student. As well as this, they must try to maintain the authenticity and security of these results when they are being taken AT HOME. Given all of this information, what all could they really do? If they had decided to import the ENTIRE test online (multiples essays, short answers, multiple choice), students would complain about the difficulty and there would likely be even more technical difficulties due to people's internet cutting out across such a long time span. If they had made a longer test and more relaxed time requirements, it would give students even more ability to cheat and share answers, further compromising the security of the test. While imperfect, I think the current format for test-taking is about as good as they could have gotten it. My only real gripe is that I wish the personalized email option had been open to the first week test takers, but I suppose hind-sight is 20/20. Regardless, I would like to hear if anyone on this sub has a better alternative to the current testing format, genuinely.

**2. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNFAIR TO CANCEL ALL THE TESTS**

Another common sentiment I see on this sub is that tests should have been cancelled right out of the gate. This is simply an immature thought in my opinion. If they had done this, I have no doubt that people on this subreddit would have been livid given the fact that they had just been robbed of the opportunity to gain college credit. I know personally, a large number of my friends are counting on their current APs to exempt them from a number of their college classes. While the current testing format is imperfect, I appreciate that given all of this craziness, we are still given the ability to further our education. Additionally, If you truly believe this testing situation is too unfair, College Board is accepting all refunds so you don't have to take them if you don't want to (I understand some schools require you to take the test as a final/mandatory curriculum. I do think this is unfair)

**3. THE REPORTS WE HEAR ARE LARGELY EFFECTED BY BIAS**

I am extremely empathetic of those who experienced technical difficulties when submitting their APs, but it is important to realize that the reports we hear are largely inflated by selection bias. Those who have technical difficulties are more likely to voice their concerns than those who did not. This effect is often called the ""vocal minority."" Again, while unfortunate, it appears that no test in week one had a failure-to-submit rate of more than 8%. That is still a sizable number and should be considered, but is definitely not the amount that is being portrayed by this sub. It should also be said that those who experienced errors (at least in my class) commonly did not take the required submit time (5 minutes) and instead gambled by attempting to submit with 2 or less minutes left. While this is obviously unfortunate as well, it should be understood that at least some of the submits errors were user-based issues

**CONCLUSION**

It needs to be said that the current situation we are in is difficult. We are taking a test that is different from what we have prepared the entire year for and it is completely fair to be upset. However, painting College Board as this purposely malicious entity is simply not true. I believe there are improvements that could be made on the current system (The retest window should happen RIGHT after week 2, there should have been more stress-testing done on the current website, email option should have been standard, greater accessibility to test taking options), but I also think that the current iteration we have is pretty okay and not as bad as everyone is displaying it as. Regardless, I would love to hear your opinions on the situation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gmdryc/truly_unpopular_opinion_online_aps_are_a/,1744,"As someone in college who forgot to leave, I personally think they should just awarded college credit as long as you had above a C in the actual class. 90% of the credits you get from AP are GEs anyway.

323,fg1xme,False,Other Discussion,134,PSA: you CAN get into T20s without being seen as elite in middle school!!!,ApplyingToCollege,"So unlike probably a lot of people on this sub, I was NOT one of those kids that took Algebra 1 in Eighth grade rather than in high school. All of my friends were on that path and pretty much everyone who was average at math or better at my school seemed to be on this path (yours could be different!)

I am a senior, and I am only in Pre-Calculus. Months ago I was really paranoid and asked both this sub and r/chanceme if I would be able to get into T20s without having been in calculus or even having the prerequisite for calculus; I got a resounding “no” from pretty much everyone. Whatever, I still applied and worked my ass off on my applications.

So months pass and just a few weeks ago, I get my acceptance to Vanderbilt. What???

I got comments from these subs telling me that even as a social studies major I wouldn’t be able to get in because I wasn’t on that path. I applied *STEM* and got in!! 

The school system likes to shit on us, and tell us how good we’ll be at math in the future and decide what path we’ll be on in High School as early as the 5th grade with no chance of mobility onto the upper path. I spent the entirety of my high school years regretting and being very upset about the fact that I was bad at long division in 5th grade and was consequently put on the “dumb kids” path for the entire rest of my K-12 years. 

It CAN be done. I wanted desperately my junior year to make up for my lack of rigor in math by doing well on the ACT section, and I still ended up with a 28 max on the math section because my school only catered to kids on the “smart” path for ACT prep. However, I was still damn proud of myself for getting a 28 math while i was only in the middle of Algebra 2. I managed to get a 35 or a 36 on every other section and get a 34 SS, and even though I only scored a 28 on math 3 times in a row, the ad board at Vandy apparently still saw something in me that they thought would lead to me being an incredible STEM student. 

I will reiterate for the last time that IT CAN ABSOLUTELY BE DONE. I’m sorry if you were deemed “dumb” in 5th grade and weren’t able to move into the “smart” path like I was, but if you show that you have kickass ECs, a passion for what you want to study, and a thirst to do well despite your circumstances, you will be OK!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fg1xme/psa_you_can_get_into_t20s_without_being_seen_as/,1742,or it’s largely chance so there will always be stories like this attempting to break the mold ,2020-03-09 21:09:57

326,gclsgk,False,Rant,164,Unpopular opinion: I’m happy that the rest of my senior year was cancelled.,ApplyingToCollege,"Now I’m by no means saying that I’m happy this whole corona situation happened. It’s awful that people have died and suffered from this disease. It’s awful that people lost their jobs and loved ones. And I’m definitely sad about the possibility of my freshman year of college being ruined.

However, I was done with high school. Senior year especially. I had overloaded myself with 6 APs and two leadership positions that were taking a toll on me. My grades were slipping. I was at school from 8am-4pm then spent 4 hours after school four days a week going to tutoring because my grades were slipping. Then I went home and did more homework/studying. Then I got like 3 hours worth of sleep, woke up, and did the whole thing over again. I was exhausted.

I was on the breaking point. I didn’t have time to take care of myself, to eat properly, I was drinking 3 cups of coffee/energy drinks a day, I had no time for my friends or hobbies that I enjoyed. So when it was announced that school was cancelled, I was super relieved. That endless cycle was over. 

I’ve been catching up on sleep, cooking healthy meals for myself, catching up on tv that I enjoy, talking to my friends on the phone, spending lots of quality time with my dog, and taking care of myself. I don’t mind that I have to give up prom and graduation. I don’t see it as “not getting recognition for the past four years” or something valuable taken away from me. I was miserable throughout all of high school anyway and a dance and a long ass ceremony wasn’t going to fix that.

I don’t know if I could’ve lasted 3 more months doing what I was doing. I probably would’ve broken down at some point. But now that I’m at home with lots of time to myself, I can rest and rejuvenate. So yeah, this whole situation does suck. But I’m secretly thankful.

I do feel bad for people who were genuinely looking forward to senior activities though. I hope you’re able to find some solace through these tough times. Just know that better times await us.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gclsgk/unpopular_opinion_im_happy_that_the_rest_of_my/,1728,"While it's great you're enjoying yourself, and you definitely should be, if everything's clear and prom and graduation are back on, I'd recommend going. You might feel like it's not worth anything, and of course it's your choice not to go, but I think it's nice to have some positive memories of high school at least. ",2020-05-03 06:15:04

The dude really sold it too, he had been VERY active in the chat for 2-3 weeks before dropping his ""news"" and changed his insta bio too. All of this was just to get sympathy from girls, and he also tried getting some of us to buy and send him merch and raise money for him for ""surgery"". We have a student intern from the admissions (or some other thing through the school) department in the group chat (shoutout babu) who got his hands on an admitted students directory and he exposed him to everyone and now the group chat is in shambles.

330,bq9eab,False,None,51,"I wrote 1,655 words about my college application process to help current juniors (and younger people) with theirs. You should read it but you'll probably skim it and maybe upvote it because you respect how much time I put into it. Oh well",ApplyingToCollege,"Hey /r/A2C,

I graduate in about week and haven’t been spending much time on here lately because my college apps process is done. I’ve been meaning to write something like this for a while but just never got around to it because I kept putting it off. I’m going to list off some tips that helped me during the process.

To start, I’ll give some background. I’m going to be a CS major next year at a pretty good CS school (PM me for more info because I'm not trying to give away a lot of personal info, but I would say it's one of the most popular schools on here. It's not an Ivy, but it's near the top for CS).

***

Research now what you need to do. I found out last September I needed two recs and SAT subject tests for some schools. Make sure you find that stuff out now so you aren’t in trouble next fall.

***

I think essays are a big source of anxiety over the summer before senior year and your first semester of senior year. It might sound crazy, but my honest advice is to not take them so seriously. Like, yeah, they matter, but you can literally write about almost anything. **You don’t have to write about some life-changing event.** All that matters is that it says something about you. Looking back, I spent way too long thinking about what to write about, but it became clear after the process that I didn’t need to dedicate so much time and energy to picking a topic. Have fun writing your essays. It sounds wild, I know, and I actually enjoy writing when I get to write about a topic I’m passionate about, but just chill out and write about whatever the hell you want. It’s supposed to be a view into your personality, not your best rendition of Joey's letter for Chandler and Monica. I’m the kind of person that doesn’t take things too seriously, but I know not everyone is like that, so this advice might not work for everyone. But I’m just giving my $0.02 on this whole process, so that’s what worked for me. I remember everyone freaking out about essays and what to write about last year, and, sure, I was stressed, but I just didn’t think of it as that big of a deal. Be yourself, that’s it. Some of this is on the schools too. It’s really freaking hard to write about why you want to go to a school. I’ve seen people say, “If you can’t write 300-500 words on why you want to go to a school, you shouldn’t apply there.” Maybe it’s just me, but I struggled to reach the word minimum even for my top schools. Shoutout to schools like UChicago and Georgia Tech and other schools like that for actually giving us a chance to showcase our personality. For the Why X schools, I kind of just BS’ed them. Just wrote I thought they wanted to hear and left it at that. It was in the Common App essay and other more personal essays that I took my earlier advice about just having fun writing and not taking myself to seriously.

***

Second, there’s a *lot* of great info on this subreddit. That said, there is a *lot* of misinformation too. Again, I don’t want to get into this too much because I’m trying to keep it private here because people from my school go on this subreddit, but I know way too much about my top three schools because I researched them hardcore, and I have seen a lot of wrong things on here about them. Still, in general, this subreddit is hugely helpful, especially for someone who didn’t have much help from parents throughout this process.

***

Keep an open mind. The school I’m going to next year wasn’t even on my mind in August of last year. My counselor gave me a list of schools he thought I should apply to, and I went back and forth on even keeping it on my list. Come December-January, it was my top school.

***

Don’t ED unless you’re 100% totally sure you want to go there. My top school in October didn’t have ED but I probably would have ED’d there if they did. I’m glad I didn’t.

***

Start essays early. I say it, everyone says it, and I know you probably won’t. For me, it’s not that I was so super stressed in late October, but instead it was looking back later and knowing I could have done better if I started earlier. That probably didn’t make sense. Let me rephrase: I started most of my essays about a week before they were due (I know, I’m literally the worst). I finished in plenty of time because I didn’t go crazy trying to think of ideas and nitpick every single thing. But I looked back at my essays in March (after I had gotten my decisions - *never* look at your essays after you apply until you get your decisions because you will drive yourself nuts finding tiny mistakes) and realized that I had gained so much knowledge of the college apps process since applying and I would have done a much better job if I started research earlier. Do that. It helps. I know you probably won’t, but you can’t say I didn’t warn you when you look back at your essays next year and kick yourself for how much they suck.

***

Finally, don’t be a dick. Don’t brag to others about where you got in and didn’t. I made a point to be vocal with where I got rejected because I think it’s important that people know it’s not the end of the world. Ask “Do you know where you’re going yet?” instead of “Where are you going next year?” because some people don’t get in anywhere they applied. Don’t look down on others because you never know what they’re going through (money concerns especially. College is expensive). I heard someone say, “Oh, I thought you’d go somewhere better” to one of their friends. They probably just didn’t think before they said that and meant it as a complement of their intelligence, but, I mean, come on, don’t say that. People say it’s a crapshoot, and that applies when you get in as well as when you’re rejected. Be humble when you get in places because a lot of people didn’t, and brush it off as best you can when you don’t in places because there’s another place out there for you. I’m not a big believer in the whole dream school idea because I honestly think a lot of schools can give you pretty much the same experience. We sometimes fetishize certain schools in our heads even though you’ll probably have a relatively similar experience at most of the schools you apply to. At least for me. I know some people are just applying to the top X schools for their major. Miss me with that. I would despise life at Carnegie Mellon even if they’re really good at CS. I’m just different than that socially. Not trying to hate myself for the next four years, you know? Editing to add this last part in now because this sounds like I’m just roasting CMU. I’m not. I just mean it’s not right for me personally. It’s perfect for a lot of other people. I just think I wouldn’t like it there.

***

Before I go, I want to echo what I talked about in my first paragraph about not taking this process too seriously. That’s not to say it’s not a big deal - it is - but don’t base your self-worth around where you’re going to college. My parents were pretty hands-off throughout it all so I didn’t have that much pressure, but I know some people’s parents aren’t like that. Sit back and think every once in a while, like, whoa, I get to pick where I study. I get to pick what I study. In X months, I’ll have independence and be living on my own in a place I earned the right to be at. That’s pretty fucking cool. Make this thing fun. You only get to/have to do it once. Stop putting so much pressure on yourself to get accepted to all of these colleges. If you had told me this a year ago, I would have sent you to /r/wowthanksimcured because I know you can’t “just stop” putting so much pressure on yourself, or at least most of you can’t. Just, please, try to have some fun with this. College isn’t the end, it’s the beginning (and now I’m a philosopher I guess). This is the start of your new world of independence, but thankfully you’re eased in with the help of parents and teachers and counselors. Enjoy it. Sit back and smile and think about how you’re picking your own path.

***

That’s it. Definitely not proofreading this so my bad for any typos. Again, PM me for any personal/CS-specific/school-specific questions. These are just my $0.02 so YMMV. This process is different for everyone, this is just what helped me.

***

One more thing, about ECs, I literally had 0 CS-related ECs. 0 math competitions. 0 science competitions. No DECA or Science Olympiad. Nothing like that. I had a couple years of varsity sports, community service, and some clubs I’m interested in. Do stuff you like. Not stuff you think colleges will like. I’m not going to lie and say it wouldn’t have helped me if I had USACO Gold (I honestly don’t know what that is but I’ve seen it on here as a good thing), but I don’t think the cost of trying to get that (and probably failing) is worth what I would have given up.

Jori Johnson took the practice SAT test as a high-school student  outside Chicago. Brochures later arrived from Vanderbilt, Stanford,  Northwestern and the University of Chicago.

The universities’  solicitations piqued her interest, and she eventually applied. A few  months later, she was rejected by those and three other schools that had  sought her application, she said. The high-school valedictorian’s test  scores, while strong by most standards, were well below those of most  students admitted to the several schools that had contacted her.

“A lot of the rejections came on the same day,” said Ms.  Johnson, a 21-year-old senior film major at New York University, one of  three schools that accepted her out of 10 applications. “I just stared  at my computer and cried.”

The recruitment pitches didn’t help Ms. Johnson, but they did benefit the universities that sent them. [Colleges rise in national rankings and reputation](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/rankings/united-states/2020#!/page/0/length/25/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/stats) when  they show data suggesting they are more selective. They can do that by  rejecting more applicants, whether or not those candidates ever stood a  chance. Some applicants, in effect, become unknowing pawns.

Secondly, yes. You should probably not be applying to competitive colleges as a poli-sci major if you live in DC, and can't take advantage of the opportunities there. If you're going for less competitive schools, you're probably fine, as stats are enough, but top schools want to see you taking advantage of the situation. They compare your app to the other people in your area, and if the other people in your area are interning for presidential nominees, you've been beat.

Also, you're definitely NOT taking advantage. Maybe its different in DC, but over here many internships and volunteer opportunities do not require citizenship. In fact, I'm sure if you emailed the ones that do and explained your situation, at least ONE would make an exception.

I withdrew my applications to every college I submitted an application to. I decided to enlist in the Air Force instead. I swore into the Delayed Entry Program just before Christmas and I've never been happier.

Why did I decide to forego college? Its not because I couldn't go anywhere or because the military was a last resort option. I have good stats (33 ACT, 3.87 GPA, strong ECs, and several prestigious awards). It wasn't because I couldn't afford college (between savings, scholarships, financial aid, and half of a GI Bill, I could've paid for college with minimal debt.

I enlisted because I really wanted to. I haven't booked a specific job yet, but hopefully I'll end up in an Aircrew or Intelligence job. I am going to complete my Bachelor's on Uncle Sam's dime (thank you to all of you who pay taxes, its appreciated) and then get a Master's degree paid for by my GI Bill once I get out of the military. I can do all of that in about the same amount of time that it would take to finish six years of university (BA and MA) level education.

I'll be 19 years old making a decent salary with no debt and very few living expenses, complete health care, amazing opportunities, guaranteed college tuition support, and probably a Top Secret clearance. 

So I urge you, if someone you know decides to forego college entirely and forge their own path, military or otherwise, support them. Don't tell them they're throwing their future away. Don't say ""But you have so much potential."" I'm excited about my future and the opportunity to get a Bachelor's, a Master's, and a career opportunity debt-free. I'm not throwing my future away, I'm taking a while to do what I love and reap the maximum possible benefits from it and hopefully come out ahead.

Best of luck to all of you as you select your colleges and finish your apps. I love you guys and I want the world for you.

Bye for now ✌️

In today's era there are so many free resources you can take advantage of, I've seen people recommend Khan Academy over all other forms of test prep. The CB also offer fee waivers to low income families for the SAT.

A lot of people who mention SAT tutors seem to forget that actual tutors are a thing as well. Beyond that, while a grade is able to be changed months after a class was taken, an SAT score is tamper proof.

Also, while SAT or ACT testing centers are held pretty much everywhere, the same can't be said for great ECs. Many are dependant on location, connections, or being able to pay for the expensive activities. It's hard to win a national competition if you can't afford to attend.

Even LORs benefit wealthy students. Many of my first gen friends didn't know about their importance until they started on the common app, so they were unable to lay the groundwork with a teacher in the spring.

Overall, the college admissions system is heavily in favor of the wealthy, so it feels odd to vilify the test that you could walk in and ace in one shot, instead of the activities that require constant deposits of both time and money that low income students just don't have.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gonsvr/opinion_the_sat_is_the_most_fair_part_of/,1658,"There will always be arguments ab which is more unfair, but I believe college admissions take into account where you are from and what ECs you are able to do.

369,fat9yk,False,None,101,It doesn’t matter,ApplyingToCollege,"Ok, so I was accepted to Vandy ED1 and have spent the last few months pulling hard for all my friends to hit their college acceptance goals. 

Last night my parents had a business dinner at our house.  My father’s firm does this quarterly, where about 25 employees and their spouses show up to one of the principles’ homes and the company brings in a caterer, etc. This was the first time it was at our place in a few years. 

Anyway, while it’s not the field I’d like to go into, my parents encouraged me to socialize during the cocktail hour. I’ve known a bunch of them for years, but now they were all asking where I was going to school, etc. Here’s the thing....These are all extremely successful businesspeople. Advanced in their fields, ranging from about 30-50 yrs old. As they asked me where I was attending, most also shared their alma maters.....

Everywhere. A few Ivy, a few other t20....and then a whole lot of “normal” quality schools. State schools, “party” schools, regional schools to where they grew up. At the end my mother and a guy who went to Penn were talking with me and I brought up the fact that the makeup was literally all over the map. He laughed. We all know this inherently, but he reiterated that outside of a very select few industries where you go to school isn’t particularly relevant once you hit the pavement of the real world. He pointed out a woman who went to community college for 2 years, then our state school to finish. Said she was the best negotiator in the company, and had a Stanford and a WashU grad reporting to her. He then made a point that they don’t particularly like to hire “elite” school interns. Said over the past decade or so, there has been a lower work ethic from them. He’d rather take the relationship they have with a few regional or state schools, get their best and brightest, and go from there. 

So....for everyone stressing about the prestige of schools you want to get into.....it legitimately doesn’t matter. It was really good for me to see that, because it reminded me that getting into the school I wanted to isn’t the end game.

Second, there seems to be a huge dispute between GPA or SAT/ACT score. I too, am biased when it comes to disputing whether test scores or GPA is a better measure of academic potential (stronger GPA than test scores). Yet, they're both going to be evaluated, and people shouldn't be discredited for having a strong GPA or strong test score.

I only applied to 3 schools (don't come at me lol). 1 was my dream school -- UPenn -- while the other 2 were target and safety schools. In March, I found out that I was waitlisted at Penn. After writing a LOCI (and sending it the same day I got the decision), I was informed in May that I got accepted off the waitlist.

My financial aid came in a few days after my acceptance, and once again I was disappointed because there was no way my family and I could afford it. After sending in an appeal, the financial aid office gave me more aid, but it was still not enough. 

*So I sent in another appeal...*

After waiting for two weeks and making tons of phone calls, I realized that the financial aid office did not see my second appeal. One of the counselors there eventually told me that Penn does not usually review 2nd appeals and suggested that I take out loans. However, after making a few more calls, my mom was able to contact the actual committee that was in charge of reviewing financial aid. They told my mom that they would look at my second appeal the next day and update me that evening. 

I'm happy to say that Penn gave me even more aid, making the price around **$40,000** *less* than the amount I originally had to pay. And now, Penn is even cheaper than the state school I originally committed to.

I've grown in my abilities so much over the past few years, and I love playing at church. I love listening to music and playing video games, and even though I can't put that on an app, those things are still valuable to me. 

I want to get into Carnegie Mellon. I love that campus and that school's atmosphere. Even if I don't get in, I refuse to beat myself up over not being the perfect student. I made the choices I made, and I know I'll have a great time in college even if I end up going Pitt.

Spoiler: You're gonna be OK.",ApplyingToCollege,"Hold on to your hearts. This waiting can be godawful, super stressful, I know. But the cool thing is that if your ED/EA school doesn’t work out, you’re still gonna have lots of great options. I promise. (spoiler alert: even if you don’t have a surefire safety that you love and every college rejects you, you’ll still have lots of options. Crazy, right?)

I’m a big believer in doing everything you can to be who you want, get what you want, or position yourself in the best place for it. I’m all for putting everything into it while being reasonably balanced. I want you to try your hardest, knowing that you couldn’t have done any more, so you have no regrets, but then you just gotta let the universe take control. I’m old so I’ve seen it time and again, life works out the way it’s supposed to more often than not.

It’s real important that you do some EP right now. Emotional Planning. Your mental and emotional health are far more important than where you go to college. So, hope for the best, of course. You’ve worked your asses off to get to a position to even be able to apply to the schools you applied to. You wrote killer essays and presented yourself as your best you on your very best day. It’s only natural to be hopeful and you should be, but come on, you gotta be real too. The realities of admissions are that there are just too many of all these beautiful yous to be funneled into that tiny little teacup full of colleges you’re applying to, and some of you (many of you -- I’ll be honest) won’t get in. So hope for the best, but please prepare yourself for the “worst.” I put “worst” in quotation marks because I know that often what seems like the “worst thing that could possibly happen” can turn out to be something really quite wondrous in the end. One way to prepare might be to check out this [blog](http://pwp.gatech.edu/admission-blog/2018/11/28/preparation-day/) from Georgia Tech with a “National Preparation Day” pledge and all.

The fact of the matter is that we have to live our lives in the moment, and some of these moments suck and some of them blow us away with their amazingness, and some are just ho-hum. So buckle up, and prepare for some sucky moments to head your way in the next few days if you applied ED, but don’t forget to take a look around you right now, this minute, and see your friends, the beautiful blue sky (it is here today in Houston), the snow on the ground, your pets, your teachers, your warm bed, and whatever it is in your moment right now that you can appreciate.

And don’t forget we’re here on A2C to cheer for you if it does work out for the best for you, and to console you when it doesn’t.

So, here’s the real deal, the honest to goodness truth: you are an incredible person (Hard to believe I know that without knowing you isn’t it? But it’s true), and you’re gonna kickass wherever you go. You don’t need any certain school to do that. You don’t need a school to light your fire to help you on your way to be the person you want to be in the world. You don’t need any one name-brand school to spark the match that lights your way.

(2) For all her AP classes, she cheated on tests and quizzes through the papers given to her by her upperclassman friends and when students report her, the teachers are all like “____ is a good student. She would never cheat.”

Honestly, it takes alot of effort. Literally everyone I've met has said that they'd rather have me help them than report me. Most schools don't really bother to deal with such stuff simply because it is a lot of effort. Not to mention, having a high performing student be outed as a cheater reflects really badly for the school.

If you're a low performing student, chances are your teachers will try to get rid of you. Got caught for talking during an exam? A low performing student will be likely be either suspended or expelled, afterall your going away will make the school's record better.

Funny story- Even after cheating, I finished my paper just the same time as the class topper and even scored literally the same number. 

I may never know is the topper was a cheater too or not. 

Pro tip- cheating will take atleast 50 percent effort of the real thing. If it's taking less than that, you're taking too much risk already. ",2019-10-13 21:29:15

391,fbjckd,False,Other Discussion,48,"With RD season coming up: When you decline admission or withdraw your app to a college, they’ll ask you for a reason, and you should say it was for financial reasons.",ApplyingToCollege,"Colleges use the questionnaire as data to help them know who’s accepting, who’s declining, and it’s not a stretch to think it’ll be used to benefit the school especially in increasing their yield in the future.

So if you put down that you’re going to another school and put the reason as they have a better program or something else, they’ll make a note of your stats and may use it to make a more informed decision in whether to accept or decline a similar student in the future. You’ll be required to give a reason in the questionnaire too, and sometimes they require you to put down the school you’ve accepted instead too so you can’t leave it blank.

In order not to let your data be used in this way and to put pressure on colleges to give more aid or decrease tuition, put down financial aid as the main reason. There are no downsides to this. You won’t screw future classes over, and if enough people do it, it’ll make a statement. College is too fucking expensive.

EDIT: Not condoning lying, but if you’re choosing another school for multiple reasons with financial aid being one of them, put financial aid down as the reason since they’re usually only asking for one.

EDIT 2: Hey everyone, wow I wasn’t expecting this post to blow up like this. I’ve wrote a few loooong comments as replies to people who think colleges using data like this is a ludicrous idea, but I figured a lot of people won’t see them, so putting some info here. More links in the comments.

How are colleges using your data? Well, already pretty unethically. At the University of Wisconsin-Stout and over 43 other colleges (at least the ones The Washington Post found), [they](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/10/14/colleges-quietly-rank-prospective-students-based-their-personal-data/) collect your data and use it in such a way without feeling the need to tell you because to quote Buff State: “You have a choice of not interacting at all” referring to the fact that people make a choice to visit the website and they can get their info through phone calls or social media posts instead. Ludicrous, right? They’re saying you’re agreeing to colleges using your data to score you when you’re looking up information and need to make a choice between a detailed database with answers to most of your questions and an Instagram post. I think you need to access the website to find the phone number too.

At UW-Stout, they use an algorithm to assign you a score out of 100 to determine what’s the likelihood you’d accept an offer if given and use it to make decisions. It’s also not said (hmm) where they got the data for the algorithm. I’m a CS/Philosophy major, so the role of trust in an online relationship is super interesting, but to me, I think these events have diminished, perhaps obliterated, any trust in the relationship between you and colleges. Perhaps better advice would have been to not answer the questionnaires at all and forgo making a statement. Your data is valuable, so protect it. This is another way colleges obscure the admissions process to increase the power imbalance in their favor, and transparency and organizing as a collective is how we get the power back.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fbjckd/with_rd_season_coming_up_when_you_decline/,1602,"This is just misinformation all around and I encourage students to do the opposite - be truthful in your reason in choosing another school so the school can actually get informed data and better itself.

The data you provide is not “screwing future students” in any way and to say so is just false. It’s hard to imagine a single school that even uses the alleged method to weed out future classes. I can also assure you mass reporting “financial aid” as the reason is NOT going to change tuition rates or scholarship offerings. Why? Because supply and demand, the school filled its class with people willing to pay, so why change?

Be honest. That’s the number one rule for college admissions. ",2020-02-29 21:24:52

395,evltjp,False,Shitpost Wednesdays,43,Rejection from a top school...,ApplyingToCollege,"Dear Applicant,

Thank you for your interest in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

The Admissions Committee has carefully considered your application and we regret to inform you that we will not be able to offer you admission in the entering class of 2020, or a position on one of our alternate lists. This year's application pool was the strongest in the School’s history, and we are unable to offer admission to every student. 

Normally, we would state that this decision has no reflection on your abilities; however, there is a first time for everything. As stated on our website, we have geographic boundaries, and we normally do not allow admission to those residing outside of Britain. However, as your parents are British, we decided to consider your application. We would recommend that next time you state your relationship to the English, you do not write that your “grandfather was a famous British man who hid his gun up his butt to hide the fact he was a criminal.” 

We also would like to remind you that Hogwarts is a school for eleven to seventeen-year-olds. We do allow transfers, but not for last years. We certainly did not appreciate that you stated that you were fifteen when you are actually eighteen. Furthermore, you were extremely inappropriate during your interview, as you attempted to kiss Professor Granger. Professor Granger certainly did not enjoy it when you ran out of the coffee shop yelling “it’s legal!”

Lastly, the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is a school for people with magical abilities. Although it was entertaining watching the clip, we regret to inform you that waving a branch at a potato connected to a moving fan whilst screaming “levitate!” is not magic.

We greatly appreciate your interest in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and offer our best wishes of success as you pursue your educational goals.

Yours Sincerely,

Minerva McGonagall

399,fmrv9g,False,Best of A2C,98,What I learned from my Stanford Deferral,ApplyingToCollege,"A few months ago I got deferred from Stanford. I was excited at the possibility of being a competitive candidate and maybe even attending my absolute dream school; however, I saw everyone else that got deferred as competition and factors I needed to be better than. After joining a chat with about 20 other deferees ( all from Reddit)- who were all amazing in their own right- I fell into a depression and suffered from major imposter syndrome, because many had done actual research and had national awards. Ultimately, they all scared me and it felt like my chance to attend my absolute dream school was slipping away from me. I had trouble texting them and just tried not come across as stupid, but one night everyone was sharing parts of their applications and their personal narrative. I decided to join along and learned a great deal about everyone in the chat and when I shared my story I was met with an unbelievable amount of support. The people in the chat with me started to become more than just my competition but other people who worked just as hard- if not harder- and wanted to attend Stanford just as much as I did. (I'm avoiding names cause I want to keep it private) There is one girl who constantly tells us how much she loves us, one who is the nicest person I've ever met, a boy we joke is our admissions officer, a really tall kid that believes in everyone, and so much more I couldn't possibly put into words. It really hit me that applying to these big schools makes you think you're against everyone else applying when, in reality, we're all just trying our hardest to achieve our goals and succeed in life. Every achievement in our group is met with an applause from everyone, and believe me these kids are out-of-this-world intelligent. We have people that got into MIT, a large number of likely letters from Ivy Leagues, a Duke likely, so many T20 acceptances already, and so many crazy smart people. I used to think kids like this were robots, but they are so human. We eat whole bottles of mayonnaise, preform the orchestra version of the Wii theme, tell dirty jokes, and spend so many hours just being high schoolers. After spending so long with them- and as Stanford approaches- I can't help but think that I no longer care if my spot goes to one of them. Will I be upset, yes; however, I know its another kid that is just trying to succeed. They all deserve as much as I do- if not more. However, I've also seen how unpredictable the process is, kids that got likely letters from Ivys get rejected from MIT or people from MIT don't get into other less prestigious schools. I don't say this to degrade them because they are easily some of the smartest people I've met- much smarter than me- but to show how fickle the whole process is. All in all, as Ivy Day and Stanford approaches I hope y'all can realize that the whole process is unpredictable and isn't indicative of your worth at all. Everyone on this sub is just a human trying to live their own unique experience. We're not each other's competition we're just kids. We're all on this Earth confused about what to do and how to make our dreams come true.

If any of my fellow Stanford Eggs are reading this I hope you all get in and I would give the world to be able to attend Stanny with you for the next four years. Hopefully we can beat the 15%-25% acceptance rate! Even if I don't get in I wouldn't change a thing. I loved meeting all of you and bonding over our love for Stanford and learning. After Stanford decisions we may never talk again, but I hope you know you truly touched my heart!

TLDR: Apply to big schools even if you think you're unqualified the best case scenario may change your life. Heck, I did and got deferred and got to meet some amazing people. Other candidates aren't your competition they're just kids like you- many have worked just as hard and want to attend just as much. Lastly, go easy on yourself. You're just a kid and college is confusing. A rejection doesn't mean anything and you're not inferior for receiving it; vice versa for an acceptance.

Also we're considering starting a youtube channel just as a resource for kids deferred from Stanford and to show what we wrote and did to get into great schools like MIT, Caltech, Columbia, Cornell, Vanderbilt, UCLA, Duke, Stanford(hopefully), and so many more great schools)

401,guaqzs,False,Rant,344,Fellow Chinese-Americans... how are you feeling?,ApplyingToCollege,"Mods, feel free to remove this post if you think it doesn't fit, I just thought I'd post it here since it has something to do with college, although not entirely.

Among the surge of recent social & political events, I'm sure most of you have heard about the ""Secure Campus Act"" recently proposed by Republicans, which wants to ban Chinese internationals from US colleges due to spying (you can search up more about it). Many people have referred to it as a ""modern day Chinese Exclusion Act,"" whether you agree with that or not.

As a Chinese-American, I may not be directly affected (not international) but I still feel a lot of conflicting emotions because of this. First of all, it's coming literally in the middle of the covid-19 crisis, where Asians overall have been stigmatized, and the Chinese especially. Second, although like I said the bill is not necessarily targeted to Chinese-Americans, I feel like it's only increasing the stigma towards Chinese people/Asians. You only have to look under Instagram posts to see what people think... covid-19 brought nasty as hell comments about us Chinese people (need I rehash that?), and the campus bill thing has a lot of people saying things like ""the Chinese deserve it \[i.e. racism\]."" Of course, like any other country, China definitely has its share of issues; I'm not going to deny them. But I've noticed a lot of things people say are based off the actions of the Chinese governments or a minority of the Chinese population (like idk *anyone* who's eaten a bat before??) and generalizing it.

I grew up in a very Chinese household, surrounded by family friends who are also Chinese. I've always been proud of my heritage and China's background - it's one of the oldest & most sophisticated culture/country, with so many significant traditions and values. I've never wanted to be any other race/ethnicity because I've always loved being Chinese (culture =/= government btw). But with all these controversies inflaming the racist stigma around the Chinese/Asians, I've been feeling... a lot. People make me feel like I should be ashamed for being Chinese, when I know their facts & assumptions are wrong. I feel more embarrassed in public because I wonder if people are judging me based on those things. I feel *scared* sometimes. But because of that, I feel so angry as well. The same people who preach BLM on their stories (which is good!) are telling me that it's not racist to discriminate against the Chinese. ...I should *not* be ashamed, embarrassed, scared, to belong to an ethnicity that I'm proud of, yet society seems to keep pushing this on me.

Idk... are any other Chinese-Americans (or other ethnicities too :)) feeling similar or have thoughts on this situation? I'd like to know how people my age are feeling about this, outside of my friends/school, esp. since this sub has a decent Asian population I believe. This turned into a mini rant, so again mods you can delete this if you see fit. But thanks for reading.

BTW... I am very aware of the other health, social, & political issues the world is facing rn. This is just about the issues with China specifically :)

402,djpb31,False,None,40,Stuck on your essay? Here's a psychological trick,ApplyingToCollege,"Early Decision deadlines are coming up and I've started to see people talking about being stuck on their essays.  In the next two weeks this will reach epidemic proportions.

I get it. This is important and you want it to be perfect.  Some of you haven't even started, or have a hundred false starts and they all seem to suck.  You stare at the blank page and nothing seems like it is going to work.  You've done your homework and read a lot about the things that you shouldn't say in your essay and every time you write something it seems like a cliche, or pretentious, or unappealing.  Your parents and teachers are nagging but you just can't find the words.

One trick that I have seen working is to set out to deliberately write the world's worst essay.  Go ahead!  Swear, use jargon, brag, be stupid, be silly, be trite, be a stereotype, be pretentious, be obnoxious, be mean, be petty.  Just sit down and get it all out of your system.  

Once you start keep on writing until you run out of momentum.  Then put that aside and do something physical for 20 minutes to an hour.  Dance, go for a walk, rake the leaves, clean your room, do yoga, whatever.  Just do something that gets your blood moving and doesn't need your brain.  Once that's done, pick your joke essay back up and read it out loud.  Do funny voices if they fit.  

You could find that once you've gotten the bad writing out of your system, the good writing is hiding right behind it.  Or you could find a phrase or sentence in the terrible essay that sparks a thought and leads to a really great essay.

For extra bonus points, when your parents nag you about your essay progress give them the terrible essay and pretend you think that it's good.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/djpb31/stuck_on_your_essay_heres_a_psychological_trick/,1588,I've written three of these damn things and I still can't get it right. ,2019-10-18 15:43:13

&nbsp;

My sophomore year (two years ago) I was on the school tennis team, and one day we traveled downtown to an all-day tennis tournament between teams from all over the city. The parents dropped us off and we were on our own other than our coaches. Halfway through the day I noticed this freshman on another team forgot to bring a lunch. He was sitting by himself hungry and alone and I felt bad, so I went over and offered to buy him something. He politely declined but I knew he was hungry and insisted he eat. I went over to the snack stand and bought him a hotdog and some ice cream for $5 and brought him over to eat with my group of friends. After we went back to our own tennis tournaments and I thought nothing of it. 
&nbsp;

At the end of the day as I was leaving some woman ran up to me in the parking lot and greeted me by name. It was the kid's mother so I'm assuming he had told her about me, and she thanked me over and over again for buying her son lunch. I told her it was no big deal and I was happy to help. That was the only time I saw that woman...
&nbsp;

...until two months ago when I arrived at my Columbia interviewer's office. I walked in and she greeted me happily, as if she knew me, and it didn't hit me until I got into talking about playing tennis that it was her kid who I had bought lunch for two years ago. I didn't bring it up but I knew it was her, and I knew she knew remebered me when she brought up that day. It was by far my best interview. 
&nbsp;

Two months later, I was rejected from every ivy/ivy+ except one, and that was Columbia. I honestly can't believe that this happened and I really have no idea how much of an impact that event had on my acceptance, but I'm pretty sure she wrote about it in her interview report and that's what got me in. After I got in (literally like 2 hours after), she sent me a super ecstatic email about how much I deserve this acceptance and to keep on doing what I'm doing. Never thought something like this would happen in my life.

&nbsp;

**TL;DR** Went to a tennis tournament, saw some kid forgot his lunch. Bought him lunch for like $5 and his mom was super thankful. Two years later that mom was my Columbia interviewer and remembered who I was.

How do you feel about introducing my (eventually) 14-year-old to this sub?

What leads me to reject the *llaissez faire* approach are the kids saying ""I got rejected by all the top 10 colleges I applied to"" and ""I can't afford to go to any of the schools that accepted me"" and (in a related sub) ""I got a 1240 on the SAT, how do I get into the 1500s in three weeks?"". 

IMO, it's good to start early so kids have time to learn what they need to succeed on the SAT and college application process. My focus with my 12-year-old is on getting him to read a lot, which I don't do by fiat but by explaining how that will help him and by providing him books he enjoys reading.

424,fw9eb7,False,Rant,250,Just got into a huge argument with my parents over not wanting to go to MIT,ApplyingToCollege,"I just filled out the USC Housing application and got to the page to submit the $55 application fee... apparently talking to my parents about deciding between multiple schools didn't make it clear enough to them that I wasn't going to automatically commit to MIT. I was bombarded with 30 minutes of yelling, accusing me of ""being a pussy,"" ""being retarded,"" and ""having serious mental health issues"" in Chinese (Damn, what a failure I must be for that).

Obviously I was insanely happy when I got into MIT. I was over the moon for about an entire month. But after that initial euphoria went away, I began to really process what going to a school like that would mean. I've worked insanely hard for my grades in high school, and I was never the type that would be able to not study for tests in order to excel. I always felt stressed out by everything, and the ""college resume building"" aspect of my life took over my entire mindset. Although I've never had the guts to go to a therapist or seek professional medical attention, I'm sure I've experienced depression and anxiety far too many times during my four years in high school.

Through more research online and talking to current/former students, I've come to realize that MIT truly might destroy me. I'm already extremely fragile mentally, and the advice I've heard over and over again is to not go to school if you fall apart under stress. Sure, the graduation rate is extremely high and I'll probably be able to make it through, but at what cost to my mental health? High school has already broken me many times -- how is MIT not going to be even worse? The only thing I realized I truly like about MIT is the prestige associated with its name... and that's precisely why I don't want to go there right now.

When I tried to tell my parents my thinking, they refused to even contemplate the reasons as to why I'm having doubts in terms of attending this \*magical school\*. They told me every college would be hard, and while that's certainly true, is it possible to deny the fact that MIT will almost certainly be more intense and riskier for my health than other, ""worse"" schools? The campus made me feel miserable when I visited, the horror stories I've heard have scared the shit out of me, and I honestly can't see myself enjoying my time at MIT. But my parents said that ""MIT is too prestigious for you not to go,"" that ""there is a reason why their yield rate is so high,"" that they ""couldn't stand to talk to me again if I chose to go such a bad school like USC.""

Maybe I did this to myself. My entire life, I've been a sheep to my parents. I listened to them when they insisted I needed straight A's since the beginning of middle school. I listened to them when they told me I couldn't hang out with my friends during the school year because a ""good, smart Chinese boy had better things to do with his time."" I listened to them when they told me that a ""perfect ACT/SAT score will set you up for your entire life."" I even almost listened to them when they told me to quit playing a sport, literally the one thing that has kept me sane throughout the past 6 years of my life. Now, they expect me to blindly listen to them again. But this time, I can't.

I don't know what to do. I know that I will probably regret passing up the insane academic opportunities at MIT if I don't go. I know that I might never be able to heal my relationship with my parents if I don't go. I know that, if MIT doesn't destroy me, it is probably the best choice for me to go to college. But how do I know that it won't destroy me? I can do more research, but how can I know for sure that I will be fine if I go there? How do I make the right decision? I can't even discern my own thinking from that of my parents. I don't even know how to end this rant. I'm just a giant freaking mess.

I keep seeing posts about people saying they're not getting anywhere because they only applied to super elite schools and didn't get into any. There are other colleges, you know. 

Apply to safe colleges, if you still really want to go to the one you got rejected from, go to the safe college and get really good grades, reapply, and transfer. The only way that you can be a failure after getting rejected from all of your choices is if you choose to literally not do anything else. 

As long as you get a degree, people really don't care where it came from as long as it wasn't a trash college. Also, just because it isn't ivy league doesn't mean it's trash. There are plenty of schools that are better and have better outcomes and aren't ivy league, ivy leagues are essentially the brand names of colleges. It's the same thing, packaged differently, and harder to get.

Edit: excluding the jobs that require an ivy league degree (stuff like Wall Street), most jobs won't not hire you because you didn't get an ivy league degree. 

Moral of the story: if you got rejected from all of your colleges, life isn't ""over"", apply to a school you CAN get into and either get your degree there or transfer. Transferring is hard and unlikely, but it's not possible at all if you don't try.

428,cqakh4,False,None,72,UPDATE: Applying to college with a 1.4 GPA.,ApplyingToCollege,"Hi everyone! I made a post last fall as a senior in HS regarding my low GPA, basically asking if I had a chance at getting into any school other than community college. I decided to log back on and update anyone who read my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/9or8i0/14_gpa_do_i_have_any_chance_anywhere/) and/or cares.

I was able to get a fee waiver so I applied to ten schools. I emailed each school with a brief explanation of my circumstances and asked for my applications to be analyzed with more weight on my senior year grades than my previous three-years. Four schools told me they'll write a note about it in my file, three assured me that they review the applications holistically, and three straight up said no.

Out of the ten schools I applied to, I was accepted into two, waitlisted at two, and rejected from the other six. I interviewed with, and was accepted into a private school in my state with about an 82% acceptance rate. The second school I was accepted into has a 96% acceptance rate. One of the ones I was waitlisted to was my absolute top choice.

For a while, I considered attending the private school I got into, but I just didn't love it there, the campus feel wasn't for me and I'd have preferred a bigger school. The other one that I was accepted into is beautiful but across the country.

I decided to go with community college. I took 16 credits this summer with a 4.0, and recently began the Fall semester where I'm taking another 16. I'm applying to a few schools as a Spring 2020 transfer, including my top choice which I was previously waitlisted to, but I haven't decided for sure if I want to transfer this Spring or wait until Fall 2020.

436,fr4hru,False,Best of A2C,280,"A message to future international STEM applicants, particularly Asian students",ApplyingToCollege,"Admittedly, I'm using a throwaway account.

I'm currently an international freshman student at a certain college in America. I wanted to share some (unasked-for) insight for future international applicants who are interested in STEM.

First, my stats. I want to emphasize that I have no intention to brag about my accomplishments, so please don't take this the wrong way.

(To keep my anonymity, most stats are kept vague but are written so that the gist is understandable)

I am an Asian male looking to major in a certain field in engineering.

GPA:  4.0/4.0 (Constantly in the top two throughout all my years of high school, which is one of the top three high schools in my country. We need to pass multiple tests to enter our high school.)

SAT: 1560/1600, first try (not that that means anything)

SAT 2: 800/800, 800/800, first try (Math 2 and a certain science subject test)

Extracurricular activities *(Most are kept vague to preserve my anonymity):*

* Invented/Discovered a certain new thing under the mentoring of a university professor, published paper and accepted to present at an international conference
* Won national competition in a certain field. The twist was that other than me every other participant was a  college student pursuing their masters degree in the field
* Captain of a high school team competing for a certain well-known international contest
* Won in multiple national contests related to my field
* Started multiple clubs at my school, and every club has won a national award of some sort
* Recognized and was provided full-ride scholarship grant by my country for the four years of my college (excuse my passive voice)
* etc.

Most professors in my country who are in my field of interest knew who I was from my research and I've been interviewed for a news article too-which isn't an extracurricular, but I want to emphasize that my application can probably be considered to stand at a very high level.

Essays:

In my senior year, I've written 1216 essays (This includes short 100 word essays all the way up to the common app). I know; it sounds like BS, but it's true.

International students *WORK THEIR ASSES OFF.* I remember living on an hour of sleep and spending a constant five to six hours every day writing and rewriting essays for a whole year. I had everybody I knew (including a relative who has experience with college applications/essays) and consultant professionals check my essays.

After a grueling 1216 essays I was confident that my final products were the best I could produce. My common app way my revision number 83. I did everything I could, paying attention to each and every word in every essay, and admittedly submitted my application at 11:58 P.M. All my essays were perfectly at the word limit, which doesn't mean jack sh\*t but yeah.

Some parts I could've improved were my SATs and my submission time; I definitely could've spent more time grinding out practice tests to aim for a 1600, and while it's said to not have an effect on college decisions my submission time was probably a bit too close to the deadline.

Again, I'm not here to brag.

And now my results.

Out of the 21 schools I applied to, I was accepted to three and wait-listed/rejected by the rest. Yes, I applied to Ivy league and so-called ""T20"" schools. I got into one Ivy league school (No, not HYP) and two other very awesome STEM-focused schools who were kind enough to give me a smile of acceptance.

Now that I've gotten that out of the way, here's my message to the fellow future STEM international applicants.

* The whole admissions process is ""unfair"" and biased in countless ways. Why? I'll explain in the following bullet points. But I guess that's just how life is.
* Asian + Male + STEM, especially CS, ME, or AE = You're going to have a very hard time.Yes, being female will increase your chances of getting into a better school; this is very clear from admission stats. I'm not trying to undermine the accomplishments of the accepted female students and saying that they've achieved less than their male counterparts; I'm saying that with the same/similar level of stats, most colleges will probably choose the female applicant. I'm also implying that yes, the ""each and every person is special!"" is BS.
* Contrary to popular belief, yield protection does exist.
* This is probably well-known already, but international students need to achieve WAY higher than the average student in America to obtain similar results, i.e., ""We consider each application without regards to race and ethnicity"" is obviously BS.If this was actually true, American colleges would be flooded with international students, particularly from China and India, but in that case, where would domestic students go?In other words, the international applicants from competitive backgrounds are most likely VERY, VERY smart. One person I know who goes to MIT is a math genius; not just the ""typical international math Olympics gold medalist,"" I'm talking Von Neumann-level of genius. Dude literally solved the hardest problem on the math Olympiad in under 15 seconds.That's the competition you're (or rather, us international students are/were) going up against. And one thing that tends to go unseen is that it's VERY, VERY difficult to even do an extracurricular in most Asian countries, whereas in America opportunities are abundant and handed out to students who want to participate in them.Colleges need to have ""diversity"" in their student body; they can't just admit every qualified international applicant (Which, in my opinion, is fair. Every country has colleges international students can go to, and American colleges are technically for American students in the first place). Your race/ethnicity/family income are all (uncontrollable) factors in your college application. Even if you're super good at what you do, if there are tons of others with the same conditions then you'll have a less chance of getting in compared to somebody who has ""achieved less"" but has unique uncontrollable characteristics. Accomplishment itself is a very relative factor.This is one reason why you shouldn't feel disappointed in yourself when you don't get accepted to a certain school; you were qualified-perhaps even more qualified than a portion of the admitted students-but you were waitlisted/rejected because of something you can't control. At my school, I hate to admit that around 70% of the people here aren't the shiny, omnipotent Ivy league students people think they are.
* As a STEM student, you aren't only judged by how smart you are. As in, you can't just be good at the technical stuff, unless you're so good that you're number one in the world and nothing else matters, even your grades and SAT. You must create an image of yourself where you're also good at things like PRing and the humanities, your ""compassion and care for others"" in your application in some way. I believe this holds true for the future, when we apply for jobs/positions too.This does go against the traditional  ""follow your true passions"" BS, but like explained in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fqo68j/aos_cant_actually_detect_authenticity_or_passion/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x), most applicants are doing their extracurriculars for the application, not their passion.
* This follows from the previous point, but if you want to get into a good school you are most likely better off pursuing something that sounds good on an application than your true passions.This is the reality.In my case, I was lucky enough to have my real passions work out for me at the end. I've continued my research in college, and things are working out quite well. But chances are most people won't be as lucky as I was.Sadly, you just can't write about your hobby of gardening unless you've obtained a really prestigious award which shows your ""artistic skills.""
* The vast majority of students from international countries who are applying as a STEM student and were accepted to HYPSM have an Olympic Medal or something close to that.No well-known international/national awards? You only have a slim chance of getting into T20s, and even if you do have a prestigious award, you still may not get in. In my case, everybody around me was shocked to learn that I didn't get into HYP. Again, I'm not trying to boast.
* Essays are very important for domestic students, not international students. Of course, there are outliers but in general your extracurriculars are what get you into T20 schools. But if you are willing to bet on that sliver of a chance where you're going to be that outlier, you're most likely in for a big disappointment. I'm not saying to give up and not try;  I'm saying to not aim too high and expect to prove reality wrong. Unless you're Einstein, it's probably not going to happen.

My point is, to all the Asian international male students who are looking to major in a field of engineering: I'm sorry, but most of you won't get into your top choices, especially if your top choices are Ivy League-level colleges if your extracurriculars aren't at a godly level. The chances of a Chinese or Indian student getting into an Ivy League school are just too low and too competitive.

From my personal experience and what I've heard from others, this is the harsh truth.

438,h8ezgq,False,Essays,111,"STOP pushing ""sob stories""",ApplyingToCollege,"Edit: Wow this got popular! My goal is to respond to everyone's questions by about 10pm Pacific on Monday. Thanks for your patience.

I've seen this sentiment circulating around here and some sister subs so instead of just making a dozen comments, I'm going to post this.

In response to anyone saying things like ""admissions officers love 'trauma porn' "" or ""sob stories are the way to go, anyone saying otherwise is lying"" or anything else disgusting like that: No. 

Nobody cares about your ""sob story"". I've been in the college amissions game for 8 years, first in Cal's Admissions office, then in the private sector.
I am so sick of hearing all this entitled, unqualified, ignorant nonsense.

If someone chooses to write about overcoming obstacles - and I've gotten numerous students into Ivies and flagship public schools (UMich, Berkeley, etc ) without them doing so- the focus needs to be on the skills the student gained from OVERCOMING said obstacle, not some ""sob story"" nonsense. 

Are you a skeptical cynic? Well then, think of it this way, nobody, I mean NOBODY, is going to admit you because they feel bad for you. Nobody reading your app could give half a clipped toenail about your personal circumstances unless they think those circumstances have made you a valuable asset to their school. 

Here's WHY students with shocking backstories get in to colleges. Because they became mothertrucking b*d*sses from it.

In research and in your professional life, spaghetti is gonna hit the fan all the time. Didn't get a research grant? Great, how are you going to get a new one or do without? You know what a good parallel for that is? Resourcefulness in the face of childhood poverty as a first gen college  student, as you figure out how to apply for food stamps and the FAFSA all on your own while your dad is outside the trailer drunk with the boys again.

Your undergrad minions all caught COVID and now they can't  ZOOM Interview research subjects? Great, how are you gonna juggle all that? Maybe with similar time management skills you developed having to work 20 hours a week in minimum wage jobs after school while maintaining a 3.8 and being president of your school's speech and debate team.

You're in residency and dealing with some very recalcitrant patients. You think back to when you were translating for your diabetic mother who couldn't speak English much less read an English nutrition label. You remember what you did that finally got her to listen and try the same type of empathy and understanding on your patients. They finally start getting it.

Or maybe you think back to when you were bullied because of an autoimmune disorder that had some unsightly physical effects and made you weak. You think about how you got through that, no way in heck you can't get through the disappointment of getting a C your first OChem midterm. You study your butt off and pass with a B (not great, but there's legit hundreds of thousands of doctors who still became doctors with a B or even a C in OChem. It's OCHEM.).

I could go on and on and on.

So many kids who have never faced anything remotely like hardships or setbacks CRUMBLE in these kinds of situations because they've never had to pick themselves up and wipe all the mud and blood off themselves. Resilience, tenacity, resourcefulness, determination, perseverance, ALL of these are qualities that are key for success in the real world. Colleges WANT PROOF of that. The ability to APPLY your smarts is just as important as being smart. That's why 4.0s with zero proof of life skills are sometimes rejected over super capable 3.7s.

Sure, a couple spitheads might slip through the cracks and get in with a pity essay - that was likely because they had a really strong rest of their app, or they're just really good a BSing. One shyster succeeding with crap isn't enough to endorse the sob story method. Plus,  most of those people  flunk out and wind up working a pity job at their daddy's company or minimum wage somewhere else. 

Nobody cares about how hard you had it if you didn't develop some valuable skills because of your experiences.

We both grew up and our relationship has gotten better but we can still fall back on that fighting territory pretty easily haha So just watching him so happy...God, that's not something a person can buy.

My other brother is about 22, but he has Schiz and stays at home. He rarely talks but I love him to bits. A couple months ago I was asking him how he would feel if I moved away and he just looked away and muttered he wouldn't like that. He already felt betrayed by our other brother who moved away for college and outright refused to talk  to him on the phone for a long time.

I haven't talked to him yet but I have the opportunity to stay home and I want to tell him (I'm away rn).

447,aa7hr3,False,None,149,Does it ever strike anyone else that this entire process is completely and irrevocably fucked?,ApplyingToCollege,"Basically every college has an essay that boils down to ""Why do you want to go here?"" and I'm pretty sure we all feed them complete bullshit. The actual answers boil down to:

""This college is financially reasonable for me and of sufficient proximity/lack thereof (if you really just want to leave home) that it is convenient, and also you'll probably accept me.""

""This college is prestigious and I think I might have a shot.""

""Everyone needs a backup.""

""My parent(s) went here so you'll almost certainly accept me and I like the idea of it.""

""My dad bought you a building."" (for those asshats who can say that)

They must know, right? Most students are going to get a perfectly serviceable education pretty much anywhere. Barring post-graduate work and actual research, most colleges are going to be pretty much the same. Colleges are like people: everyone around them tells them they're special, and all those people are lying. Do they just pick based on whoever lies most eloquently? I don't mean to suggest we lie about the basic facts of our lives. No one would make up an extracurricular or fake a grade, because they'd get caught, but we definitely misrepresent ourselves to be way more invested in each *particular* college, when really we're just happy if we get accepted by *any* college we'd find acceptable. Why the hell do we grovel at their feet, when they are far more invested in us than we are in them? FFS, we get spammed with email and actual physical mail advertising to us. (Hint: We grovel because our parents are not-so-secretly completely fucking terrified that we might do worse than them, and if that happens, it means they're FAILURES AS PARENTS PANIC PANIC PANIC)

Also, the hell is up with letters of recommendation? My teachers have actual jobs. It is not part of their job to help me beg a college for admission. It is their job to teach me. Not to mention the quality BS that goes into recommendation letters, as well. Numerous teachers just keep form letters, then fill in names and adjectives.

Standardized tests, too, are a whole crock of shit. They're tests we pay to take from people who encourage our anxiety over them and then sell us test prep in order to profit from that same anxiety. We act as if they reflect the entirety of our self worth (at least until it comes time to show colleges our essays, at which point *they* become our self worth).

Just... for fuck's sake, we've created an educational system that puts people into so much debt that they spend their entire lives paying it off.

460,e6szia,False,None,69,A (Mostly) Rational Argument,ApplyingToCollege,"Update: Rejected. But when one door closes, another opens.

Ok so I applied to Stanford REA, and, as the decisions come out tomorrow, I'm actively trying to digest the butterflies swarming in my stomach. All of my friends are applying to Ivies either EA or ED, and anxiety is HIGH at my school. So, here's my thinking, if you'll bear with me.

Earlier this year, I heard about a really interesting study that was done on two unique groups of people: people that had recently become paralyzed, and people that had recently won the lottery. As expected, the Lottery People (LP) were very happy, and the Paralyzed People (PP) were comparatively not. However, when these people were evaluated 1, 2, and 3 years later, both the PP and LP exhibited VERY SIMILAR levels of happiness.

So, what does this mean in the context of my favorite Reddit forum, A2C? Well, you can take it to mean whatever you want, but here's my rationalization: tomorrow at 7 pm, when I clear the textbooks off my desk, and sit down with my computer to check Stanford admissions, one of three distinct options will occur (deferral, rejection, acceptance). I'm really hoping for the big W, but realistic. (What's the acceptance, like 9 percent early and 3 percent regular decision? Geez) But regardless, whether I am crushed and paralyzed by the metaphorical ""rejection bus,"" or get lucky in the ""acceptance lottery,"" in 1, 2, or 3 years, I'll be just as happy either way.

College acceptance is not our worth. College acceptance is not our value. College acceptance is not a reflection of our character, intelligence, or aptitude. And most importantly, college acceptance is not going to determine our happiness. Good luck to everyone, and see you at 7 tomorrow.

465,b66giw,False,Major Advice,83,My advice for my son tomorrow (and for you today),ApplyingToCollege,"Tl/dr:  Today is rough, but the quality of your life is determined not just by your successes, but by what you can do with what you have. 

Edited to explain to the front page: March 28th is Ivy Day, the day all the Ivy League colleges release their acceptances at once. It’s the end of a long, grueling application process where many people active on r/ApplyingToCollege didn’t get into the elite colleges for which they were hoping. 

Background:  My son is a typical youth for this sub. Let’s call him Ty. Ty had two older siblings. Child 1 was happy to go to State U (40,000+ students) where Child 1 probably drank too much and encountered their fair share of bureaucratic hassles, but had fun, graduated with the degree they set out to get, are now gainfully employed and wear the school colors with pride. Child 2 got an almost full ride at a nearby small school where the average SAT is almost 200 points below theirs. Child 2 is triple majoring (history, anthropology and philosophy) and is having a great time traveling around the region with the school’s club quidditch team. Both ended up at perfect places for them. 

Now along comes Ty. He has always been driven and his stats show it. Salutatorian, 1470 SAT and 34 ACT. Made 5s on both his AP tests last year and 800 on the Chem SAT subject test. Is taking three more AP classes this year, including BC calculus which wasn’t offered at the school until Ty rewrote the math curriculum to get it taught  But there’s more: 4 year varsity athlete, competing at states his junior year. He’s an Eagle Scout who still completes > 100 hours service a year at the food pantry where he did his Eagle project 3 years ago. He’s had the comedic bit role in the school musical for the past two years.  He’s a golden child but has worked hard for a lot of it. 

So when, as a junior, he started talking about T20 schools, I assumed he’d be a natural fit. We were both seduced by the beautiful campuses, the engaged students, the Nobel prize winning professors having office hours and advising freshman, the distinguished alumni and their fantastic networks! What an amazing world was about to be unlocked by the key Ty had spent 4 years forging!! 

We visited other colleges too, but Ty was clear on what he wanted. “Child 2 is at a place that’s too easy, mom. If they were being pushed, there is no way they’d have all that spare time.” Or— “I do not want to go to a party school like Child 1! Plus don’t you remember their hassles with classes and advising like when they had to do summer school because class X, a necessary prerec, filled too quickly?” Or—“I’m tired of being bored in class and I don’t know yet what I want from life. These top schools will challenge me and introduce me to fields I don’t even know exist and people from backgrounds I can’t imagine!” By August he had three schools he loved, what we thought were a reach, fit and safety, just like A2C had told us to do. 

Of course, the price tags at all the elite schools seem scary, but the colleges told us not to worry. “Look at our endowments! Look at how generous our aid policies are!” In addition to his two older siblings, Ty had three younger ones who all will need to go to college, plus my parents live with us. His father and I figured out a tight budget. With, previous college savings, Ty working, and a lot of scrimping we figured out a hard ceiling of what we can afford, higher than what we had paid for Child 1 or Child 2. I was sure there would be enough aid and scholarships to cover it all. We’d done this twice before. 

You know what happens next in this story. December hit, with deferrals for him and his other brilliant friends.  Number 3 in Ty’s class got outright rejected from the school we thought would be the perfect fit for Ty. We realized that this was a much different, much harder game than the one we thought we were playing. Most of Christmas break was spent applying anywhere that seemed appealing. 

And, as they’ve been for many people on this sub, things have continued to be disappointing for Ty. He’s been waitlisted or denied by several schools.  Being rejected by the honors college at State U was particularly hard and still baffling to me. And then there are the schools where he’s been accepted but we just can’t afford, even with generous scholarships thrown in. 

Which brings us to now and Ivy Day. I’m pretty sure that there are going to be rejections, or best case, unaffordable acceptances.  I imagine will be the case for several others on this sub as well. 

So here is my advice: Ty, you have shone all through school. And we both bought the promises made by these colleges during the admission game, that these are the schools which will fix your star in its proper place in the newest constellations that they alone create in the sky. 

But real life is full of disappointments. At 18, you cannot imagine how many times over the next 70 years you will have bad breaks and not get what you deserve. I can promise you, there will be many days so much worse than this one. For every person, there will be more pain than they should ever have to bear 

Life, and you, though are so much more than the sum of the hurts you endure. At 18, you get to define who you are and what you will do with all you are given— not your family and not your alma mater. Your character is not determined by your lofty advantages but by what you can do with what you have, even or especially when you don’t think you have been given enough. You have so many opportunities and if you have half the grit you’ve shown in the past, today’s pain, real as it is, will be just passing. 

The fact that you don’t want to go to State U is actually irrelevant right now. It’s a fine university and what we can afford so it is where you will be. It’s an opportunity that many, many folks dream of having and you are damn lucky that it’s a reality for you. Humility is a very underrated virtue. 

In fact, I think State U may be the best place for you. You have taken advantage of everything your high school could offer and more. You are like the fish who has grown too big for your pond.

I know these elite schools promised to give you the world. Let’s see what you can find at a university that wants you to make your own way. You only think you are a big fish. You are going to be poured into the ocean. Using your ingenuity, intelligence and hard work, let’s see how big you can grown here. The ocean may be vast, but I am convinced you can thrive in it. And know Ty, you are loved beyond measure. I am so proud of the man you have become. 

For the rest of you: I wish the best of luck to everyone on this sub, even if you don’t get the thick envelopes from what you think will be the perfect schools. All of your work will not be wasted, but will only give you the foundation to excel wherever you end up. 

Thank you for indulging a super long post. I wasn’t ready for the reality summed up by u/admissionmom ‘s insight that there are just too many wonderful candidates to pour into the tiny teacup of T50 schools. 

I’m very grateful for this sub. All parents want to give their kids the world. It’s been rough realizing over the past few months what Ty wanted wasn’t going to happen and very helpful to have a place where others are in the same boat.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/b66giw/my_advice_for_my_son_tomorrow_and_for_you_today/,1455,"As a mom of a junior A2C has been such a reality check.  I am shocked to see the gpa's, board scores and ECs of these students and then then lack of acceptances to the schools.  The whole process is flawed.  Back in my day of college admissions no one did test prep and now it is a booming business that is skewing admissions.  I understand that the thought is that it is leveling the playing field with high school grade inflation but it is also putting kids into top tier schools that didn't do the work on the front end.  It is also disappointing to see athletes with much lower scores being admitted (I'm talking at Ivy league) and stellar students being rejected.  It is also difficult to see (which people aren't going to like to hear) that minorities and lower income students except asian students being admitted with lower scores.  My two daughters who are in high school have been told by their friends who are hispanic that they will be admitted over my daughters even with lower scores and the girls laugh.  It is a very difficult and slippery slope.  I don't think that T20 is the be all end all.  Like another person commented it is about how some of these top students worked so hard, took the hardest classes, studied their butts off and got perfect grades for what...going to their flagship state school with students who did nothing.  That is the feeling of the student and I get it.  I don't feel that our state school is bad but when the state school isn't keeping the best and brightest students in the state the students want to look elsewhere.

467,hi8kts,False,Serious,51,Unpopular Opinion- Being rejected by your dream school is probably a good thing,ApplyingToCollege,"Obligatory throwaway account notification\*\*

So title sounds crazy, and I'm sure there are many exceptions to what I'm about to share, but maybe, just maybe, there is a bit of truth in my story. **I know my story doesn't always apply to other cases**, but I will share anyways. 

I'm a current senior attending a prestigious t10 university. It doesn't matter which one really, and I won't specify for privacy, but most of them are about the same level of rigor. I was one of those kids that was *Ivy League Bound* in high school. 4.0 GPA, 1500+ SAT, a buffet of AP classes. I  was the president of 3 clubs, varsity sports, concertmaster of orchestra, won writing awards and science scholarships and all that jazz that you see circulating around A2C. 

My teachers told me I was brilliant. And I believed them. 

But I had a secret. After coming home from all my  club meetings and track practices and violin lessons, I sat down and studied for hours upon hours upon hours. I stayed up until 2 am most nights and got up at 6 to start the whole shebang again. 

Although I was jacked up on AP classes, things didn't come that easily to me, especially math and science. Which was a problem, because I was a prospective premed engineering major. I would study twice as hard as everyone else to get the exact same grade, and I know that it's impossible to know for sure how much other people studied, but from anonymous surveys and several different testimonials, I was studying a lot harder than other people and it was not paying off. But I fought tooth and nail and finally got an A (along with 90% of the class lol).

I wasn't happy with my life and many of my activities I didn't enjoy, but I kept on pushing because I wanted to get into my Dream School ^(tm). Sometimes I lost sight of my dream. I started saving up my antidepressants in my sock drawer just in case I felt the sudden urge to end it all. But I thought that ""if I can just make it through high school it will all be ok"".

So fast forward to April of my senior year. I was extremely blessed when I got my first t20 acceptance from Duke \*yay\*, and I was like ""this is it, this is what I've been killing myself for"". It was nice to feel validated for my efforts. I picked a prestigious private university over my state school and had a ""college reveal party"" and it felt so good to be done. 

But the thing is, once you get accepted to an Ivy League or t20 university, you are not done. It gets 10x harder from there. I moved into a larger pond, and I was surrounded by some of the best and brightest students in the world. Most of which didn't have to try in high school and were somewhat naturally gifted. We had so many math whizzes in our engineering department that it became so hard to keep up. I studied constantly and neglected working out, showering, eating, and enjoying my life. 

But no matter how hard I studied, no matter which study techniques I used, my grades were just mediocre. Grade inflation may keep you from failing, but it doesn't keep you from getting bad grades. I was depressed and suicidal and I was seriously considering dropping out of college. My whole life I had the mentality ""if I work hard enough, I can get ahead"", and while that is somewhat true, sometimes you just can't do any better. 

Sometimes no matter what you do, it isn't enough. 

Things have gotten a bit better, but not good enough for me to be a competitive medical school applicant. I am going to a different school to get my Masters and then reapply to medical school. 

This is not to tell you that you shouldn't have a dream school or that you shouldn't go to a t20. My advice is: Don't let getting into college consume your life. Do activities you love instead of resume builders. Don't lie to yourself, you know you are doing *some* things just to put on your resume.  I, being the pre-med gunner I was, stocked shelves at the hospital for 10 minutes a day to bolster my resume, even though it literally did nothing for myself or the hospital except give me a talking point on my application. 

Remember, YOU have control over your life. Not the admissions committee. I felt like getting into college controlled me, and I let it take away my adolescence because of it. 

Study, but don't study to the point of neglecting your mental, social, emotional, or physical health. Study for the SAT, but don't waste thousands of dollars on prep courses, prep books, tutoring, and retaking it 6 times because you want a 1550. 

My t10 university was not the place for me because I tried to live my life in terms of my high school resume instead of doing things I loved, regardless of if they weren't resume builders or not. If I was my true self, I probably wouldn't have gotten into my ""dream school"", but that's okay, because I would have fit in a less competitive environment. 

If you try to live as yourself instead of living what colleges want you to be, you will end up where you are meant to end up.

476,epws3n,False,None,46,"Everyone tense about admissions, read this",ApplyingToCollege,"I suck at school.

When I was younger, I used to play video games a lot and I used to half-ass my homework just so I could jump on with my friends. I was never a hardcore or late night gamer, but it was better than math homework.

Middle school, I stopped playing, but for some reason, I still half-assed my homework because I felt like I was going to go play video games. For the next few years, I did the same. I always thought I had something better to do. I didn’t particularly like school, but I didn’t hate it either. Around the B or C student.

In high school, I still didn’t do anything interesting, but I was still in that mindset that I had something  better to do than homework. I was never busy, I just wanted to get done with it. This messed me up sophomore year, where I failed my math class, chemistry, and European history class, and passing two other classes with a B.

That summer, I retook chemistry. Made zero sense, but got satisfactory grades and burned all those papers. Last school year, I retook math. I was going to be the only junior in a freshman/sophomore class. The first day, I sat in the corner of the room and didn’t talk to anyone. Eventually, the three girls around me found out, and they were cool with it. They knew I was good at other stuff, but just not at math. Got out with an A- both semesters.

PSAT was 970. First attempt at SAT was 1060, second attempt was 1140. ACT was 22.

That following summer, I retook history, A in both semesters. Well, what does any of this have to do with anything?

Although it sounds bad, I’m happy I failed those classes. Sure, my parents were pissed, but I’m happy where I currently am, and you will be too soon. Knowing my GPA, I didn’t even bother applying to any UC’s (I live in Southern California), but instead bulked up on calstates. I thought I’m never going to get in. I thought my grades aren’t the A’s colleges expect, my 3.8GPA sibling had a hard enough time getting into UC’s, and here I was with a 2.4.

Today, I got my first acceptance. Sacramento State. My friends were getting early admissions, I was in this super tense moment. It’s like I was telling myself I’ll get in somewhere, yet knowing I wasn’t going to get anywhere cause I don’t have the hottest academic record. I thought it’s the end of the world. I’m going to end up going to a nearby community college, never have time to hang out with friends cause I’d be commuting, and then have my parents on my butt all year.

Your acceptance letter is coming. Your future is coming soon, and you’re going to love it when it comes. It may not be your number #1, it may even be a school you didn’t look TOO much into. Just know that whatever comes, whether it is your #1 or your #22, you have a plan. You are going somewhere. It may not be where you want to be, like me in my math class. But you will start a new life, with new people. When you’re out and about in the world in a decade’s time, NO ONE will ask you what you got on your SAT, or your AP Chemistry test, or that tough unit test in spanish.

Remember, water boils the same whichever college you go to. Whether you go to UC Berkeley or a nearby community college, you will be successful. Sure, Berkeley may be a big leap and community college may be a small leap, but you’re getting to where you want to be — just at a slower rate. The path to success isn’t a straight line. There’s lots of bumps, lots of turbulence, and lots of tough waves.

Hold tight. Your acceptance letter is on it’s way. If not today, then tomorrow. Tell yourself that every single day. One day, you’ll come home and open up your email. That email will say:

“It is my pleasure to offer you admission to ________________ for the Fall 2020 semester.”",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/epws3n/everyone_tense_about_admissions_read_this/,1449,And then there are those who never get an acceptance letter. ,2020-01-17 06:42:39
477,gtzma5,False,Rant,108,College students and prefrosh are NOT QUALIFIED to give admissions advice or offer paid essay review services,ApplyingToCollege,"I'm sick of prefrosh here doing AMAs and acting like they're admissions experts when they have yet to take a single class at their universities. Worse, some are trying to make a quick buck off nervous juniors by offering paid essay review services.

Yes, I know they're fairly rare. But I'm seeing more and more of those slimy posts as the next app season approaches. (EDIT: When fall comes, there will probably be far more. Rising seniors, don't fall for it. Plenty of college students will review your essay for free)

By the way, college students doing these things are no better than the prefrosh. Does a college English class make you qualified to offer paid college essay review services? It's such a shocker for me that college English classes teach you about admissions practices. Are colleges trying to set us all up for high-paying careers in college consulting? Awesome!

(/s . tq Poe's law)

Also, dear prefrosh, you don't know what got you accepted. I don't know if your T20 acceptances went right to your head and got you so excited that you forgot what humility is, but unless you're one of the lucky few with an AO who gave you a straight answer about what got you in, you don't know shit. Did your reader love your writing? Maybe she played the same niche sport as you, giving you that tiny bump in her mind that you needed to get in over that other kid with perfect stats.

Wait until you get your admissions file to talk about ""what got you in,"" although in **some** cases, your admissions file might as well be written in hieroglyphics with how many different scores some schools assign each applicant, each score for an unknowable abbreviation like Stanford.

>""TSR, HSR, Sup, EC, SPIV, CAPE, MD, IVE, PE — everything is encoded in a mysterious admissions officer language. [https://www.stanforddaily.com/2019/10/16/i-looked-at-my-admissions-file-heres-what-i-saw/](https://www.stanforddaily.com/2019/10/16/i-looked-at-my-admissions-file-heres-what-i-saw/)

Anyway, **college students and prefrosh are not qualified to talk about admissions like they know anything,** unless they're quoting a current or former admissions officer or a (legitimate) college counselor or applying advice from such a qualified individual. Sharing your own story is cool. Telling others that this or that is what got you in is not.

I can't tell if it's willful blindness or just a general lack of balls, but people on this sub go on and on about injustice and inequality but rarely bother to take 10 seconds to post a comment calling out prefrosh on bullshit and report unqualified essay reviewers to the mods. In this sub's eyes, it's cool to rag on CollegeBoard for money-grubbing but fine turn a blind eye to prefrosh ""sharing their opinions"" on what matters in college admissions and take money from nervous juniors for a service many of the kind college students on A2C will do for free.

Randoms on A2C ripping off kids clearly isn't as big as CollegeBoard shooting a salvo of fees at us, but the former is something you have far, far more control over. Downvote, comment, report to mods. This sub is too fucking tolerant of bullshit from its own members.

Edit 1: For clarification, college student AMAs are often helpful. They can provide valuable information about their schools' students, culture, and so on. The AMAs veer toward uselessness and misinformation when they walk the path of admissions speculation. I don't mean factual discussion about their ECs, essays, etc. I mean true speculation on how this or that extracurricular was the best one, or that their essay was everything. He/she should not be making those statements before reading his/her admissions file (assuming their university isn't one whose admit files say nothing meaningful).

I should also clarify is that prefrosh can be very helpful with, as u/tripsledge states below, the application process. There are countless low-level details like how often prompts change, whether a school requires official score sends, and so on. Prefrosh can answer those basic questions well. But again, they don't know what got them accepted and shouldn't pretend to.

&#x200B;

Edit 2: Most of the commenters obviously didn't even read the post, so here's a

**TL;DR:**

(1) College students & prefrosh should not charge students for essay review. That is unethical for reasons outlined above. Furthermore, the fact that you *can* do something does not mean it's ethical to do it.

(2) College students & prefrosh shouldn't act like they're admissions experts. Speculation on a complicated and often random process like admissions is not useful. Hard facts are great. Sharing your own story is great. Info about schools from college students is great.

(3) This is not a rag on all college student AMAs. Me saying *""college students aren't qualified to speak authoritatively about admissions""* somehow got interpreted as me saying *""all college discussion bad bad bad""*",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gtzma5/college_students_and_prefrosh_are_not_qualified/,1441,"I totally get where you're coming from but at the same time, there are students that exist who actually went out of their way to talk to admissions officers. Personally, after getting all my admissions, I scheduled zoom calls with all of my admissions officers to talk to them but also get more insight into what really got me into these schools.  And TBH, I don't see the difference between a prefrosh who got into X reach school editing essays and some other essay editing service done by ""professionals"" who got X how many kids into reach schools. You have to start somewhere LMAO, and TBH I would rather have a prefrosh who got into multiple reach schools edit my essays than someone whose a ""professional"" editing them that hasn't gone through the application process in years.

479,gjv9um,False,Rant,87,Prestige changes people...,ApplyingToCollege,"Long story short, I was accepted to a top university. It’s the first time this has happened in my area so everyone was pretty impressed. 

However, going through high school I was never really liked by most of my teachers. I worked hard but they didn’t like me due to my family connections. Both my mom and sister went to the same high school I did, and they both had mental disabilities that made them difficult for the school to deal with. This meant that they were a hassle to teach, and therefore not liked by the faculty. This ended up also applying to me as I went through high school. Even if I did well, I didn’t have the right last name and often got kicked to the side. 

Now that I’ve been accepted into a nice school, everybody likes me now. My old teachers who unfairly graded me and refused to recommend me or nominate me for school positions are now friending me on facebook, making posts about how they’re so proud of me and that they are honored to have taught me, and sending me personal messages of how they are glad they helped me in my journey. They’re talking to my mom, who they once treated so poorly, about how proud they are of her and me both. She knows it’s all lies and attempts to take credit for me. 

These teachers did the bare minimum to help me, and now it pisses me off that they’re trying to take credit for the success I’ve had that they tried so hard to keep me from. I hate all of it. I was always teased at my school by the principals and guidance counselor for applying to big schools. They would always mock me or say I was wasting my money. And now that I’ve actually done something, they’re so excited to post me on facebook and brag about me on senior day.

480,daxxwc,False,None,151,"From a low income, URM, and first generation senior, the true reason for inequality in college applications is not standardized tests, but extra curriculars.",ApplyingToCollege,"I understand that many studies show that those considered disadvantaged are going to score lower in the SAT/ACT than others, but that is a reflection of a larger inequality inside the U.S. Not only will their test scores be lower, but also their grades, volunteer hours, activities, etc. 

Getting a good SAT score 95% of the time requires heavy studying. My first PSAT score junior year without any studying was a 1260, then a 1370 on the April 2019 SAT. It was above average for sure, but no where near where I wanted.

Now here, people can claim that someone richer than me has access to test prep programs, tutors, Barron's books, etc. It's true that I was unable to use these resources when studying. I didn't need them though. Today, there is plenty of free resources that can be just as effective. If someone wants a past SAT QAS, 90% of the time you can find it free online. If someone wants to study reading and writing, Khan Academy is actually a really good resource. The only money I spent for studying was Uworld, which for $50 for two months, gave me the tools for an opportunity for a perfect 800 on math(Even if I would end up not getting that). In my viewpoint, better to spend $50 now with my own money from work than be burdened with thousands in loans. 

If you don't already know, if you have free lunch or any other requirement, you can go to your counselor and get a fee waiver, which provides 2 SATs, 2 sittings for subject tests, and an unlimited amount of colleges you can send your SAT scores to.

Over the summer. I studied well enough to manage a 1500 on the SAT(750,750), even with one of the worst math curves. My financial woes didn't prevent me from getting a score I wanted.

Great. Now with a great score, and a decent GPA with 11 APs, based on academics alone I can compete for top schools. 

But we all know academics is your ticket to the lottery, not your ticket in. There's still essays, recommendations, and extra curriculars. Two of these things don't depend on your finances. And this is where the true inequality arises.

A student's access to extra curriculars depends entirely on the socioeconomic status of their neighborhood and school. You won't find clubs dedicated to olympiads or volunteering at poor schools. Some sports may require a registration fee, and require the student to pay for their own equipment. Some sports might not even be available. While I do go to a good school that does have access to all these clubs/sports, sometimes the time needed to participate simply doesn't exists.

If you're poor, you know that family responsibilities make up a significant portion of your life. Whether it be work, or babysitting younger siblings for extended periods of time(sometimes even for whole days), there just isn't enough time during the school year to do what we're passionate about.

For me, it's the latter. In the summer, I would care for my 3 year old sister for around 8 hours a day, leaving me with just enough time to study for the SAT, and nothing else. Despite loving football, and even being in a position to start, I had to quit not because my parents forced me, but because I knew I couldn't give the time needed to be great or even good at the sport.

People rag on athletes for getting scholarships to top colleges with lacking qualifications, but at least someone will know they've worked hard for their goals. I know the only reason students get internships, or get to work alongside college professors, or somehow publish papers is because of connections. And they tell me this directly.

I care for my sister, providing food, education, and safety, yet if someone helps out at a soup kitchen, my hours are invalid, and theirs is viewed as ""giving back to the community"" and ""selfless"". So many students at my school school claim to volunteer often, but when pressured to say what they actually do, it winds up being essentially nothing but goofing around with friends, and they happen to be at a senior home. They don't help anyone, yet they are the good samaritans.

I know many people actually volunteer in good faith, and I commend your service. I also commend those who were able to follow their passions in biology, piano, basketball, or whatever they deem so. Just understand that not everyone gets the ability to even develop their passions. No, I can't just ""get involved"". I and many others have responsibilities that prevent us from such. 

If anything, the main reason I want to go to college is to finally do the things everyone else does on high school.

Passions are supposed to be the staple of our applications, instead of a seed that has yet to sprout.

482,b5jplt,False,None,215,UPDATE to the post: My crush rejected me because she's committing to UCLA,ApplyingToCollege,"Okay so I'm just gonna start of by saying today has been the craziest day of my life. So I told you guys I was gonna ask out the AP lit girl, which I did but before that something else happened. 


During one of the longer passing periods/breaks (15 min), I was at my locker just grabbing my textbook, you know the usual, when the UCLA girl who I asked out comes up to me. We just say hi and and stuff and talk about a class and then there's this awkward silence, which she breaks by saying, and I'm being dead serious, ""look, if you want to date, I'm down but the reason I didn't want to at first is because I really hate USC and if we date I feel like I might want to hurt you"" 

Like any normal person, I was thinking WTF. Literally reminded me of that ""sweet but psycho"" song idk but holy shit. I was inwardly freaking the fuck out but played it cool and told her I understand and it's okay, and that we probably shouldn't date then. She just nodded and left and I just stood by my locker for like 5 min wondering what the hell just happened. 

So the break ends and I'm in AP Calc thinking that maybe I just heard her wrong. Maybe she meant emotionally hurt? So I kinda just pretend nothing happened and then 5th period AP LIT finally comes and I see the girl who my friend said likes me (let's call her Selia) sitting in her usual spot. The class was kinda empty except for like 5 people since we had 6 min before class started and people literally rush in literally 1 min before class starts. Anyway, so I go up to her and talk about the hw before saying something like ""Hey Selia, so I was wondering if you wanted to go out tonight, maybe go bowling?"" (No flames pls I know I'm not the smoothest cactus out there)

But her face just lit up and she was like ""Really? Sure!"" We exchanged phone numbers and stuff and I don't know if it was cuz she looked super happy or maybe cuz I was gonna go on my first date with someone (yeah again, no flames pls) but I just felt warm inside. And thankful that my friend wasn't trolling me and that she actually liked me lol. 

Anyway, flash forward to the end of the day, I'm heading to the parking lot and when I get to my car, I see it was keyed with the words ""UCLA Forever"" etched into it. And normally I'd have been annoyed but prolly get over it but I just got this car a few weeks ago for my birthday so I was pissed. I look around the car to see if there was anything else and notice the opposite side of the car was keyed with the words ""Fuck USC"" and then a happy face. At this point I'm livid. 

So as I'm driving home, I'm tryna think of who could have done this and then I remember what that UCLA girl said when I was by my locker. I don't know for sure if it was her, but I'm more scared than angry at this point. If it was her, holy shit. Like i'm not tryna get killed here over some stupid rivalry. 

Anyway, I get home and tell my Dad and he's kinda mad, especially since I didn't go back to the school office and tell someone. But he said it should be fine cuz he knows a car maintenance/ paint job guy who could probably fix it for free. 

So after that fiasco, at like 4 p.m, I went and picked up my date (drove my mom's car) and we went went bowling and had some food after and it was actually REALLY fun. She's pretty shy so I didn't really know her that well before this, but we share a lot of the same interests and she's... wow. I mean she's pretty, but her personality is just insanely adorable lol sorry if that's cringey but I got me some butterflies in the tummy rn. When I walked her to her porch, she kissed my cheek goodbye and... well my cheek is still tingling. I know for sure I'm infatuated with her, but I hope it turns out to be something more. So happy. Oh and she's most likely gonna attend UCSD so Go Tritons! No crazy UCLA shenanigans on her part. 

I'm legit on cloud 9 rn haha but anyway I guess if there's a moral to be taken from this, don't have a crush on psycho girls (or guys). And also, don't be afraid to interact with people you don't really talk with. You don't have to date them but who knows they may be really cool people!

When I was in the seventh grade my mom bought me a backpack after my previous one had ripped. Now I was beyond excited to have this backpack as it was the kind that had so many pockets you forgot where they all were and whistle that you could blow on if you ever found yourself lost in the woods and nice reflective patches that glowed under the street lamps when you made your daily walk to the bus stop. I had become very attached to this backpack over the years, not just because of its physical attributes, but also because it remained the only reliable thing in my life. This backpack was there for me when I got bullied by the mean boys on the back of the bus for not being good enough, it was there when I had rushed to the hospital after school to find that my younger sibling was diagnosed with brain cancer, it was there when I started high school, it was there when I had lunch alone in the bathroom stalls, it was there when I threw up on the kid in front of me's head waiting in line, and it was there for so many tiny, but life-defining experiences. Though a month and a half ago as I was walking, I felt something round hit the back of my leg. I looked down and found the mandarin orange I had thrown in my backpack earlier that morning. After further inspection, I was distraught to find a big, threads hanging, completely irreparable hole at the bottom of my backpack. I called customer service, then the store I had bought it from, only to find that there was nothing I could do. My backpack couldn't be saved and I would have to finish the last 3 months of highschool using a tote bag or whatever else I could find. I had hoped to end my academic journey thus far with this backpack, do the kind of symbolic send-off that only happens in feel-good paperbacks. Three days later school was canceled because of COVID-19, and two days ago I was informed that school would be closed for the end of the year, marking the official end of my high school career. I just found it kind of oddly sweet, a little nod from the universe, the ""death"" of my backpack almost directly coincided with the ""death"" of highschool for me (and for all of us). I don't know if I'm reaching and maybe it's just a simple coincidence, but I just felt compelled to share the nice story of my oracle backpack amidst everything that's going on. I hope everyone's doing well :)

Edit: wow I did not expect my first ever post on reddit to get so many positive comments, you make my heart warm <3 you guys are all so sweet and wonderful and I could not have gotten into college without your help.

484,84r0qi,False,None,81,"UCLA is handing out 97,000 Ls tomorrow",ApplyingToCollege,"There's been all this talk about UCLA handing out Ls lately, so I did a little digging. They accepted 16,456 students last year; if we assume they accept the same number this year, then out of the total pool of 113,409 applicants, there will be a grand total of 96,953 Ls handed out tomorrow (or whenever they release). 


We've gotten to a point where a school is handing out ~100k Ls. That's a lot of Ls, almost too many Ls if you ask me. And yeah, I mean there's the waitlist too, but I'm taking that as an L if I don't get straight in. Now I know other schools hand out more Ls percentage wise because their acceptance rates are lower and yields are higher (and not everyone applies), but they don't receive the kind of volume in applications that the UCs do. So it's interesting to see the sheer quantity of Ls we're dealing with. UCLA handing out 100k Ls means...


- 85.5% of applicants will receive an L 


- Only 1 out of every 7 students won't receive an L tomorrow


- Only 14.5% will receive that coveted W


- There are 17 countries or territories with populations smaller than the number of Ls UCLA is handing out tomorrow, a few of these places are Greenland, Cayman Islands, and Bermuda. Essentially, it would be like UCLA rejecting the entire of country of Seychelles, an island country East of Africa - Population 94,677, and then some. Imagine seeing that on CNN. 

> Anderson Cooper: The entire nation of Seychelles was rejected from UCLA today


- To visualize the impressive number of Ls, just take a look at this photo of a [Michigan football game](https://www.flickr.com/photos/upnorthmemories/2234177323); every person in that stadium represents an L from UCLA. 


- This means UCLA could fill the next Superbowl with nothing but the Ls they handed out and still have an overflow crowd to rival the total season attendance of last year's Cleveland Browns.

- There's 34,748 subscribers on this sub, which means UCLA could theoretically hand us all about 2.8 Ls if they wanted to. Not that they will, because I'm sure plenty of people on here won't be getting an L, but it does put into perspective the number of Ls that will be available and imminent during decision time. 


- UCLA will hand out just under the same number of Ls Harvard, Yale, and UC Hicago usually hand out... COMBINED.

- No other college in U.S. history has ever handed out so many Ls in a single year. 

- If you took a shot of tequila for every L UCLA handed out tomorrow you would be dead, like *really really* dead.

- All of this makes UCLA the most selective public university in the country, maybe even the whole world.


Lots of quick maths here, but I thought it'd be interesting to see the distribution of Ls handed out. 

Just remember that if you happen to catch an L tomorrow, you won't be alone. We are brothers and sisters in *ar.*.. *uhh*, I mean *Ls*. All 97,000 of us.


Anyway, good luck tomorrow everyone... and god speed. I hope you don't take that L from UCLA.

School shaming, whether it be an earnest chuckle or snide remark about ranking, will NEVER make someone feel nice inside. Whether the intentions be in good spirit or malicious, the only outcome is tainting what should be the happy memory of a fellow senior. Getting accepted to school, from a dream college to a safety, might be the best moment of someone’s HS career; why would you taint this memory by casting doubt and embarrassment over a peer? 

In closing, I have a small bit of advice that, while applicable to many situations, is especially relevant during this time: before commenting on a university a peer or stranger was accepted to, think of how it may impact the person in question and whether or not it would smear what should be a happy memory. Don’t be the person who creates embarrassment and sadness; support your friends and redditers *even* if you dislike the school they were accepted to!

491,9rutus,False,None,141,"Good morning, beautiful seniors.",ApplyingToCollege,"It's been exciting seeing so many of you completing your early apps and getting them submitted! Congrats and good luck to you all.  💙 🍀 

For those of you still in the weeds or even if you haven't yet begun to dive in 😳, I want to remind you to take time today and the next couple of days to just breathe.  Write your little asses off and do the best you can, but remember to pause and breathe.  

Here are a few more reminders for finalizing your early apps:

* DO NOT wait until the very last minute or even hour. Something will go wrong.  Your electricity will go out.  You'll come down with flu.  Internet will go out.  The zombie apocalypse will arrive. Your credit card won’t work. The website will crash.  Your pet will have a crisis. Try to give yourself a day, but at the very least give yourself five hours cushion time. 

* Get up from your computer and walk around every hour or so. Go outside.  Let your brain reset occasionally.  

* Read your essays OUT LOUD — to someone else if possible. You will notice missing words and funny verb tenses.  Listen and feel for bumps. That’s where you need to edit. Make sure it sounds like you. 

* If it sounds like you've swallowed a thesaurus 🦖, go back and use words you know and understand.  It's really disconcerting as a reader to feel that bump with a word that just isn't right. Use words you know.  And understand.  

 * Stop and breathe.  You might start feeling overwhelmed; just take 5 minutes and close your eyes and breathe.  You will be amazed at how much better you feel. 

* In your essays, your tone should be casual and conversational. Like you’re talking to an older cousin you respect. It’s ok to use contractions. Eliminate adverbs, especially all verys and reallys.  

* Be sure to preview your essays after loading them into the app, and see that the spacing is the way you want it. 

* After submitting, look through and make sure all the parts went through.  Especially check to make sure that your supplements were submitted. You often need to go back and send them after paying and sending the common app. 

* Recognize that this learning process is what college admissions is really all about. Reflect on how much you are learning about yourself right now as you are going through this.  No matter where you go to college, you will be more in tune with who you are for having gone through this journey of self-exploration.  Be proud of it. 

* This is the part you can control. Show them the best you on your very best day. 

Ok!  That's a long enough procrastination break -- now giddy up; get back to work!  👏👏👏

You got this! 

Remember to breathe,

505,bbs8f2,False,Other Discussion,75,What I wish I could tell my 17 year old self-- Reflections of a 2 year post-grad,ApplyingToCollege,"Hi all,

Not sure if this kind of post is allowed, if not, feel free to remove.

About me--I started college in 2014. I had a good time and got what I needed out of school, but I’ve also felt lonely and made mistakes. Here’s what I wish I could tell my freshman self. I know a lot of this may not apply to others, but I wanted to share in case it helps anyone else. Good luck to all of the incoming students :)

1. You aren’t having an existential crisis; you aren’t taking care of your basic needs. Good sleep, good diet, exercise, social contact—a lack of any of these things will mimic the symptoms of depression! Seriously, take care of these things first, always.
2. A class cannot be called “hard” unless you pay attention during lectures and put honest, good effort into doing practice problems, homework, and reading the textbook.
3. Undergraduate classes are not that hard. A reasonably smart person will be able to get an A in most of them with EFFORT. If you are not doing well, then something is going wrong with your study habits. Find out what it is so you can fix it.
4. When people say you have to choose 2 out of Grades, Social Life, and Sleep, they’re wrong. You have to choose 3 out of Grades, Social Life, Procrastination, Sleep, and Wasting Time on Social Media and Netflix.
5. There is nothing shameful about being poor; likewise, there is nothing shameful about  having your parents pay for your needs. Instead of pretending to worry about money, show your parents how grateful you are to them.
6. Your new college friends care about you a lot less than your parents do.
7. You need to wash your sheets, towels, and comforter cover. At least once a month.
8. Buy a trash can with a lid and empty it regularly unless you want your room to smell like trash.
9. Your apartment or living space needs a “deep clean” every so often. Buy heavy duty cleaning supplies early on, and use them. Don’t forget the bathtub.
10. You should put pride in your appearance. Your outfit and surroundings affect your behavior. If you wear PJs to class, you’ll act like someone who wears PJs to class. You don’t have to wear collared shirts or makeup, but you should put in a modicum of effort.
11. Roommates are not worth it. The privacy of having your own space is invaluable. Housemates strike an ideal balance between companionship and privacy.
12. You CAN have long lasting and meaningful relationships in college. You can find your life partner when you’re 18 or 38. The former does not make you immature or white trash. Love and companionship is underrated for young people.
13. Stop drinking once you feel the effects of the alcohol.
14. Don’t take dating advice from people who aren’t happy in their relationships.
15. Don’t be friends with people who don’t respect you.
16. The mental states of the people around you will affect you more than you affect them. If you spend time with people who are unhappy or anxious or overly competitive or narcissistic, you are much more likely to become those things.
17. Think about what kind of career you want early on.
18. It will all go by so fast, enjoy it as much as you can.

  
EDIT: 

19. Remember that any job will consist of the repetition of similar tasks. School is the only time in your life you will only be tasked with learning a ton of cool information about a subject of your choice. Savor it!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bbs8f2/what_i_wish_i_could_tell_my_17_year_old_self/,1392,"I don't necessarily agree with point 3, especially when it comes to math classes, as their difficulty, the caliber of students you're competing with, and your standing in the class differ greatly from school to school.

514,gbjltr,False,Fluff,68,I can't believe I did it-- some hope for the out of high school crowd.,ApplyingToCollege,"Hi all!
I have been religiously following this subreddit. I just kind of wanted to share because I'm still in awe.

I got in to every school I applied to! Xavier, UMass Lowell, Mizzou (*with an automatic transfer scholarship), and IU East. Now I'm a 29F who graduated in 2008 and when I said ""graduated"" I mean by the skin of my teeth. I was a lazy high schooler who had to go to summer school, night school, and Saturday school just to walk across stage and get my diploma at a 0.97 GPA. I really just didn't think school was for me, even though I felt for the most part capable and intelligent. I had no drive.

After a few years of retail jobs that I was miserable at and seeing my fellow slacker crew graduating I began to feel a bit envious and enrolled in my local community college where I discovered a love for education I wish I had years ago. I somehow managed to get a 3.6 GPA and join the Honors Program and now I'm staring in disbelief as these acceptance letters come in.

I'm so grateful for online programs that are going to allow me to finally be a college graduate (alas, because of work Xavier is a no-go as it doesn't have a fully online degree program =[)

Anyway, I just wanted to let any other adult that thinks maybe it's too late or they can't work a full-time job and go to school that it's entirely possible. Also for any other slackers that every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around.

520,a19ut1,False,None,219,Why UCF has (so far) been the best decision of my life,ApplyingToCollege,"Hey, guys.  Some of you may remember me from last year, when I, like you, was losing my mind over essays and test scores.  I was even sent to therapy over it. Good times. 

Well, I'm at UCF now, and I feel like a different person.  I'm so incredibly happy here.  I'm 100x healthier.  I now love school, and my anxiety has decreased dramatically.  And since I feel like state schools like UCF get overlooked/looked down upon by this sub, I feel obligated to express why it was the best decision I've ever made. 

For some background, I was a Class of 2018 National Merit Scholar.  I got a 1590 SAT and a 4.0 UW / 4.8 W GPA.  Multiple low-level awards, decent ECs.  I'm a math major / CS minor. 

1) Money. I went to UCF on a full-ride National Merit scholarship.  I absolutely do not have the words to express how much better this makes the experience.  I never, ever have to worry about student loans.  Hell, I don't even have to think about paying tuition.  I live in a 4-bedroom fully furnished apartment with 3 other people at arguably the best location on campus.  My scholarship guarantees me free on campus housing for all 4 years.  And everything, from tuition to books to housing to food, is free.  I even get a ~$2500 refund each semester which goes directly into my bank account. 

3) Quality of Education.  Yeah, I know, surprising that I'm saying this about Florida's biggest party school.  But let me tell you...UCF's honors college is LEGIT.  They give us the best professors and the smallest class sizes.  School doesn't even feel like school anymore.  The classes are very challenging and work intensive, but I'm enjoying myself so much that I barely notice.  I went from someone who hated every minute of school last year to someone who jumps out of bed every morning psyched to go to class. 

3) Opportunities.  I'm in an Honors Calc class with this amazing professor.  There's only like 17 of us, so he knows all of us really well and what we're capable of.  One day, he asks me to stay behind after class.  He says he thinks I'm really talented and he wants to work on an research project with me, which will culminate in me publishing an original thesis my senior year.  (At UCF, this is called doing an ""Honors in the Major"" thesis).  I'm not telling this story to be like ""yay me"" but more to stress that I hear about this happening almost every day in the honors college.  A similar thing happened to me in my CS class, which interestingly enough is NOT an honors class but rather a 200 person lecture (which is awesome, btw, it's actually my favorite class this semester).  

Aside from this, UCF and the honors college host internship fairs, advising sessions, and the like on a weekly basis.  I currently have three different advisors assigned to me.  I don't think I'll ever feel at a loss for opportunities--I already have a research position, as well as a software engineering internship lined up for this summer. 

4) The people.  This is already super long, so I'll just quickly mention that I've gotten the chance to make friends with so many brilliant, successful students both in and out of the honors college.  If I was under any sort of delusion that the ""best students"" would be at the ivy leagues, that was gone within the first week.  I am daily astounded and challenged by the intelligence and diligence of the students that surround me.  

So...yeah.  I'm the happiest I've ever been.  I barely remember the application process from last year.  I love UCF with all my heart and soul.  I wanna encourage you guys to stay strong, and please don't overlook ""lesser"" schools.  At first, I thought that because I was this ""amazing student"" who everyone thought was going to go to Harvard, I'd be ashamed to say I was going to UCF. Fuck that.  I'm proud as hell to be a UCF Knight.

529,djem2m,False,None,42,"University is awesome. Oh, and a few application tips.",ApplyingToCollege,"Hi seniors! It's been almost two months since I've started university, and I just wanted to share a few of my thoughts on my university experience so far for y'all: 

University is not like high school, where you hang out with the same friend group every day. You get to know a lot more people here, in your dorms, clubs, and classes. You still have a few friends that you hang out more than others, of course, but your social circle really expands. It's really the best of both worlds!

I used to go to a small high school (\~40 people per grade) and now am at a large public university. There's a lot more students here, with a more varied set of backgrounds, interests, and experiences. This means that it's a lot easier to ""find your group"" in university than in high school, simply because you're more likely to find a group of friends that you vibe with. Also, universities tend to accept people with certain traits, so you may find that you'll share more of the same interests/have similar views or habits with many of your classmates in uni than in high school. 

You also have a lot more freedom! As a high schooler, I always heard people say that university is what you make of it, and thought it was really cliche. But it's true: you're free to do anything you want in university, be it sleeping or partying or studying all day. For example, a lot of my classes are webcast, so I don't go to those lectures (not saying that you shouldn't go to lectures--you should show up if you think you need to!) and instead spend that time doing activities I enjoy (club stuff, personal projects...etc). Personally, I loved the freedom, because I'm not stuck in classes that I don't enjoy all day and can really explore what I'm interested in. 

Also, there's ALWAYS something going on, whether that be hang outs, club events, or residence hall socials. I'm someone that likes being kept busy, so it's really nice to always have something to do. 

A few application tips:

* Brainstorm a few noteworthy stories of accomplishments that you want admissions officers to know. For each of your accomplishments, you should also be able to tell an intriguing story of the obstacles you faced, how you overcame them, and what you learned from the experience. For example: ""I won Best Delegate in a national Model UN conference. In the beginning, I felt nervous about presenting in front of a large committee. However, I told myself to not think too much and just give it my best shot. As I delivered my speech, I realized that it wasn't as intimidating as I had imagined, and that presenting my ideas and research was actually fun. Through that conference, not only did I gain valuable public speaking and debate skills, I also learned to overcome my fears in situations outside my comfort zone."" From a brief outline like that, you can expand your ""stories"" to full length personal statements or incorporate them into your short essay answers. Oh, and having a few stories like these on hand also helps in interviews! 
* Start early: If you haven't started your college apps yet--do it now. It's better to have a bad first draft that you can edit in the coming weeks than a good idea in your head. 
* Revise revise revise: When I was applying, I would read over my application essays at least once every two days, and usually I'd be able to catch some mistake/improve some part of my answers every time I read through them. After two months of constant revision, my essays looked A LOT better than their first incarnations. Oh, and ask others to read through your essays as well! Try to find the people who would be the most critical of your essays--they usually give the best advice.
* Keep a copy of all your essays! Many universities ask similar questions, so you can simply copy/paste your answers and tweak them a little to fit each university. Also, don't delete your application essays even after you receive your decisions--you'll find it helpful to have them around when writing club applications in the future. 

Good luck with your applications! I know it may seem tough right now, but it only gets better from here :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/djem2m/university_is_awesome_oh_and_a_few_application/,1349,"if ur a ""Best delegate in a national model un conference"" type student u ain't even gotta brainstorm ",2019-10-17 23:24:46
530,agcqil,False,None,88,My OFFICIAL rejection letter to the colleges I will not be attending,ApplyingToCollege,"Dear **\[COLLEGE\]**,

Thank you for your interest in me.

After careful consideration of your acceptance, I regret to inform you that I am unable to offer you enrollment for the Fall of 2019. Please understand that this decision does not at all diminish the quality and prestige of your school’s acceptance, which I am sure was offered with great thoughtfulness and care. I was humbled by the passion, dedication, and commitment to excellence of your school, students, and faculty. This year, there were a record number of qualified and prestigious acceptances which were received. If I could enroll at all of the colleges I was admitted to, I absolutely would. However this would be both incredibly expensive and unequivocally irresponsible. For that reason, I conducted a holistic review of each school and want to assure you that your school was given careful and complete consideration. Ultimately, no single attribute or achievement guarantees enrollment. I could only extend one school an offer of enrollment from this exceptionally talented pool. Unfortunately, some tough decisions had to be made, but these decisions were ultimately made with both conviction and clarity, and wait lists and appeals will not be accepted.

The great and honorable former president John F. Kennedy once said, “Then too, I would like to go to the same college as my father. To be a ""Harvard man"" is an enviable distinction, and one that I sincerely hope I shall attain.” While unrelated, this quote demonstrates that even applicants with poor supplemental essays can go on to become extremely talented and successful individuals, and you should in no way feel bad about your incoming freshman class. If you have not done so already I invite you to visit my Twitter feed, \[**@USERNAME**\]. What you will find here will likely make this decision seem like an ultimately more favorable outcome, and you may even be glad I will not be on your campus this fall.

I know this is not the news you hoped to receive, but consider this: in the unlikely occasion I do become rich and famous, in no way can this rejection take away from the prestige and success of your college. Past experience suggests that a specific student a college enrolls is far less important than what the college offers those students and how it helps them develop. Ultimately, I am just one face in a sea of thousands.

I want to thank you for the interest you displayed in me and wish you the absolute best of luck as you continue in the admissions process and in your future endeavors. 

Sincerely,

**\[NAME\]**

One year later, I finally committed to a university, ~~I'm procrastinating studying for my AP exams~~, and I'm excited to take a look at the schools that have been harassing me for the past 4 years.

**Disclaimers:**

* These numbers may actually be underestimated. In the fall, I created a new email address that I thought was more professional than my last. I set up my old inbox to forward every email I received to the new email inbox, but there possibly were emails that got caught in the spam filter of my first email that I could not get access to.
* I'm not sure of the legality of this, but my high school gives assignments that are basically filling out forms with your information, and this information is then sold to colleges. I was forced to give out my information probably 5 times.
* I took the PSAT 3 times, SAT 3 times, and ACT 2 times, and never once did I opt out of the Student Search Service.
* I don't believe I deleted any emails, and I usually added them to a folder that was specifically for college mail. I don't believe I unsubscribed either, but I may have gotten annoyed once or twice and done it a couple times.
* I only ever personally requested information from two colleges: the University of Florida and the University of Pennsylvania.
* I made sure not to include any emails of the 14 colleges I applied to after I submitted my application so as not to skew their numbers.
* I counted these numbers by searching each college's name and recording them in an excel sheet, and I am prone to error.

545,hq3xmf,False,Rant,90,"Rising seniors (and high schoolers in general), please don't do what I did.",ApplyingToCollege,"I recently graduated and am matriculating at an good LAC (Claremont Mckenna) this year, but I wish I could go back and change how I treated myself during the college application process. I was able to reflect on and see how toxic I was *after* choosing my college and I had no more application stuff to worry about. For some context, I am a low-income student, went to a fairly competitive, affluent high school, and am a Questbridge Scholar.

Some things that I regret doing:

1. I *implore* you to not let the prestige of a college get to your head. It's especially hard if you use College Confidential a lot, I found. I only recently started going on A2C, and quickly saw that College Confidential is literally the most toxic place you can go to for admissions. Sure, it's helpful, but many people on that website drill into your head the what I like to call the ""T20 or homelessness"" mindset, which is absolutely absurd. There was a point where I was constantly comparing myself to my friends at school and isolated myself from people because I was so internally competitive. I had to start going to therapy again cause of this pressure, among other things. I quickly degenerated into thinking that I *had* to go to an Ivy League or else I wouldn't be successful.
2. This is sorta related to the first point, but don't look back on your failures during high school, thinking about the ""what if""s. I did this *constantly,* because my school wasn't particularly good at supporting low-income students. For example, one had to pay tuition to do enrichment summer schools classes to advance in math/science/language or whatever. I couldn't afford it, so I ended up in Precalc honors my senior year while my friends were in AP Calculus. This small thing, combined with other stuff that I dwelled on, literally destroyed my self esteem. I began doing things I didn't even like just to make up for stuff like that. At one point, I was seriously considering self-studying for the AP Calc AB exam at the cost of my mental health.
3. When decisions start to come out, don't envy your friends that get into schools that you might not get into. Don't think ""what did they do that *I* didn't?"" Remember that there are literally so many factors that go into decisions, and it's probably not because they were the president of a club that you were the secretary of, or something superficial like that.

Things that you should keep in mind instead:

1. The perfect fit school for you might not be an Ivy League or another T20. Sure, they are great schools with wonderful programs. For example, when I applied to UPenn, I was stuck on the ""why Penn"" essay. Obviously this means that I didn't take the time to research the school, and was only applying because it's pReStigIous. I knew that in the back of my head, but I applied to every Ivy and T20 I could because I had the fee waiver. However, understand that prestige, although important, should not be the deciding factor for where to want to apply/go to. Yes, it would be nice to be able to say to your friends and family that you're going to Dartmouth and impress them, but at the end of the day, *you* have to be happy with the school *you're* going to. I chose CMC because of the resources, community, and learning environment there. I could have easily chosen a recognizable ""sweatshirt"" school I got into like USC or Cal, but CMC is where I know I will be happy. Imagine choosing a school solely for prestige, but is also a terrible fit for you; you'll be happy from the attention and praise you get, but once you step on campus, you'll be miserable for four years. Is that really worth it? 
2. Look at your failures and stuff that you missed out on doing as part of the journey. When I would dwell on stuff I missed out on doing in HS, I would think about ""oh, maybe I would't have gotten rejected from XYZ if I did \_\_\_\_."" The experiences you had forged who you are today.
3. The schools that your friends got into and the schools that you got into are the schools that are better fits for you. When my (now ex) girlfriend got into UVA and I got rejected, I was fuming. However, thinking back on it, UVA is totally the wrong fit for me.

I apologize for the text dump. This post wasn't meant to admonish people that want to apply to T20s, but rather, to advise them to apply there for the right reasons, not solely prestige. And be happy for wherever you choose to go! Going to college is a blessing in itself no matter where you choose to attend :). I chose my college, and am so glad it turned out that way, because it’s such a perfect fit for me, as opposed to one of the eight ivies I applied to.

546,b3es6k,False,None,55,How I view top 20 admissions.,ApplyingToCollege,"Ok, picture this:

&#x200B;

Its 5:00pm and you have been sitting in a crowded room for nine hours. The air conditioner broke so its hot and stuffy and the technician wont come to repair it till Friday. For more weeks than you care to count, you have been reading application after application of highly qualified, exceptionally talented students of whom you can only admit 10%. If you read one more story about some kid's parents' divorce, you are going to jump out the window.

&#x200B;

Some bastard, whose hair rivals that of Marco Rubio, and who ate the danish you left in the break room with a note SPECIFICALLY SAYING IT WAS YOUR DANISH, pulls out yet another application.

&#x200B;

The applicant's GPA is about the average of the accepted students. But their test scores are a bit low by the schools standards. You keep reading the application while your eyes struggle to stay open when something catches your attention. The applicant is a pianist. Immediately your mind calls back to your dear old father, who used to play the piano for you in your infancy, and who passed away after a long battle with dementia.

&#x200B;

The piercing voice of the aforementioned bastard snaps you out of your nostalgic haze. ""All in favor of accepting""?

&#x200B;

You raise your hand.

&#x200B;

The next applicant, lets call them ***you***, has worked hard for the past four years for a highly competitive test score and GPA. They have also foregone their social lives in favor of an impressive and diverse array of extracurricular activities. They are, for all intents and purposes, a very competitive applicant.

&#x200B;

But, the room had voted to accept the last seven applicants. So now there is a bit of a subconscious push to keep things even. And, the fact that their essay is the twenty-eighth divorce story you have read today isn't helping much either. Half the room raises their hand and you have the tie breaking vote. ""Nah"", you think.

&#x200B;

Meanwhile, admissions officer Dave is at home with the flu. His parents got divorced when he was young so he has a soft spot for that kind of story. If Dave had just remembered to wash his hands before eating his chili dog, he might have not caught the flu, might have been at work today, and maybe, just maybe, ***you*** would have been spending the next four years at the school of your dreams.

&#x200B;

Do not base your self worth on college admissions. They are a better reflection of what the dean had for breakfast than they are of you as a human being. Just apply to as many as you can afford to and hope for the best. Its gambling and should be viewed as such.

&#x200B;

Good luck everyone.

&#x200B;

////Edit: Here’s the actual text////

When we learned that at least 50 people participated in a massive college admissions scam, deploying fraudulent means to get their children into our nation’s elite universities, we were appalled, disgusted, and outraged that not a single one of them was using these deviant tactics to get into the University of Pennsylvania.

It is just despicable that these privileged, wealthy families, who already enjoy every advantage, would be so deceitful and unethical in their efforts to secure a coveted spot at Yale, Stanford, or Georgetown, but not at Penn, which — friendly reminder! — is an Ivy League school. It’s extremely exclusive. Very difficult to get into. Definitely harder than Georgetown and sometimes harder than Stanford; it sort of depends on the year.

 
What’s especially appalling to us, as one of the finest academic institutions in the world, is how many of these students did not even care about their education. We’re looking at you, Olivia “I don’t know how much of school I’m gonna attend” Jade. Well, Olivia, maybe you’d feel differently if you learned about a certain someone named Benjamin Franklin, who founded the University of Pennsylvania in 1740 and also invented bifocals, the Warby Parkers of his day. You could say Ben was America’s first influencer. People already do, actually. It’s a thing. Tell your friends!

As long as you’re going to send a photo of your unathletic daughter on a rowing machine along with a check for $500,000 to a crew coach, why not send it to our crew coach? We have a river here. It’s pretty famous. Probably you’ve heard of it? The Schuylkill. Yes, that’s how it’s spelled. You say it like, skoo-kull. It’s a really lovely body of water and a great place for your daughter to pretend to be a coxswain while she just sits in a boat and vlogs. We would never have accepted the bribe, obviously, because that would go against our code of conduct. We hate crime; that’s why our law school is so good. But it would have been nice to be asked.

Paying $15,000 so the proctor will change your daughter’s SAT answers after she takes the test? Horrifying. But not as horrifying as going to such extreme lengths just to get your kid into USC when you could have sent those doctored transcripts to Philadelphia, PA. That’s where we’re located, just FYI. Like, you knew that already for sure but in case you’d forgotten: We’re in Philadelphia! What a town. It’s such an underrated city. Definitely better than wherever Wake Forest is. (Virginia? New Hampshire?) We’re biased but we can say, with total confidence, that Philly is better than New York. People say that all the time when they visit. They’re like, “Wow, this is so much cooler than I thought it was going to be! I guess my expectations were very low?”

A few days after the scandal broke, people started to talk about the Trumps and we were like FINALLY. But it turned out everybody was just giving Jared Kushner shit for paying $2.5 million to get into Harvard. HARVARD IS A GLORIFIED FINISHING SCHOOL. For fuck’s sake, what about all the money Trump promised he would donate to Penn so his daughter Ivanka and one of his dumb-dumb sons could go to Wharton?? Wharton is a Penn school, and sure, sometimes it bothers us that the Wharton brand is so strong while the Penn brand is still sort of confusing to a lot of people, but whatever. Tiffany went to the College of Arts and Sciences, by the way. At Penn.

 
Our only consolation in the face of this devastating news is that these criminals, whose schemes were a shameful violation of what is intended to be a fair, meritocratic process, will be brought to justice, and that none of them bothered to scam their way into Cornell.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/b310q6/statement_from_the_university_of_pennsylvania_on/,1310,Did they really say this?

555,aqqtys,False,Major Advice,136,How to Get Into Stanford.....By Someone Who Didn't.,ApplyingToCollege,"# Introduction

My name is Robab. I wanted to go to Stanford since I was eleven years old. Since the day I set foot on Stanford's campus, I studied my ass off in high school, did what I was passionate about, wrote and edited my Stanford essays years before I even applied, did killer extracurricular activities, and burned myself getting good standardized test scores. I read every blog possible and watched every YouTube video about how to get into Stanford. I was confident I would also get in, but not too confident, because I knew the acceptance rate.

I never really thought about getting a rejection letter.

For years, I compiled my thoughts about applying to Stanford into several Google Docs. After my rejection, I've been reviewing what worked, what didn't, and how I would've changed my application to get in. I'm a lot wiser now, a lot more aware about the things I *should've* done, and less blind to what accepted Stanford students *told* me I needed to do.

# Standardized Testing: the Thing that Matters Least

I knew this even while applying, but for some applicants it really hasn't hit them yet. Tests don't matter. Nor do they in life. As long as you have 700+s in each section of the SAT, or subject SAT, you're fine. If you have high 600s, you'll be okay if you're low-income or a minority (black, hispanic, or an underrepresented Asian like Vietnamese). You'll notice that accepted students on the internet who post ""Got Into Stanford With Low \_\_\_\_\_"" are a minority. And that's OK. Stanford and schools in general need diversity, and historically minorities have been oppressed so they can't pay to get top-notch levels of education or retake SATs to get higher scores. But I'm speaking the truth and the reality: you need above 700s if you're not a minority to be accepted. Very, very, very rare circumstances may be otherwise.

If you're wondering what my scores were, you really shouldn't be concerned. Because again, all were above 700s. But, for those who care a bit too much: 1520 SAT (770M/750R), 780 Molecular Biology. On my application, I wrote that my race was White (Middle Eastern). If you were rejected and all your scores were above 700s, then you were rejected for a reason other than your scores...

# Being Interesting: the Thing that Matters Most and the Reason You'll Get Rejected

We like to think when you're rejected from a school, especially a top school, it was because of any or some of the following: a low SAT/ACT score, a low GPA, a low class-rank, or extracurricular activities that don't reach the state/national/international level.

But we often forget another thing entirely: we simply weren't interesting enough. Before you call the cops on me, let me explain:

Since the beginning of high school, most of us (who are inevitably rejected) treat college as something pre-determined for us. We know we're going to college, we just want to get into the most highly ranked school so that we get oos and aahs from other people. So then we tailor our extracurriculars to things that we like doing that we also think colleges want to see. We start a business, because we're passionate about business... but also because we think colleges will love to see that we started one. Perhaps we start a cosmetic business, because we like makeup but also because starting a business is impressive....to colleges. We join clubs. We do laboratory research, because we like science and also because it yields tangible results that colleges will be impressed by. Perhaps we create nanoparticles and culture cancer cells.

But imagine if you *never thought about college* in your choice of extracurriculars at all? Would you pursue what you actually, truly love? Like....horse-back riding? Hiking? Would you binge-watch Korean dramas, only to inevitably teach yourself the Korean language? Would you repeatedly try to learn how to cook the perfect egg? Would you go to Washington D.C. and protest for human rights, and then get tear-gassed by the police?

The reason you were rejected was because of three things, which are all tied together: (1) to some degree or another, you think about college when you decide what to pursue, (2) you or your story isn't interesting enough, and (3) you haven't fully realized yourself. Let me explain:

When you start to think about college, you won't pursue things like horse-back riding or protesting, perhaps because you think that its not ""academic"" or impressive enough. You won't try over and over again to try to cook the perfect egg. Because you don't pursue what interests you in the moment, you become bland. In your essays, you'll talk about how how you made $1000 from your cosmetic business and how that was really hard to achieve, instead of laughing over how you fell down in front of 1000 people at a human rights protest. Instead of talking about how you love Korean dramas and taught yourself the language, you'll write about how fascinated you are with Persian art....when truly, deeply, and literally....you're not that fascinated with it. And now matter how much you embellish your essays with ""it sparked my curiosity"" and ""I delved into the intricacies of \_\_\_\_\_ and found myself lost and amazed"", you'll seem bland and uninteresting. And then, because you didn't pursue the wilderness called life, you won't fully realize yourself. You won't see your vulnerabilities. You won't see your flaws. You'll become sheltered and blind to your faults and your strengths because you stay indoors all day. You'll write essays that don't reveal much about you, simply because you don't know much about yourself. Your teachers will write recommendations that will commend you, but they'll describe you in a way that won't differentiate you from other bland, sheltered applicants.

You'll think that you'll seem interesting to the admissions committee, because you started, say, a cosmetic business (and you know no other applicant has done that), but AdCom won't see it that way. They want people who are truly, really, literally, fully *human*. They want humans who are mature beyond their years, because they've been through narratives in life that seem so rare these days and perhaps a bit outdated. They want humans who can reveal their flaws, their faults, their insecurities, who are okay with admitting about the time they were racist or homophobic or unjustifiably angry, and who don't care what others think of them. They've grown from their teenage angst or their ableist mindset, and become a better person. They're not proud of what they did or maybe who they used to be. But instead of comparing themselves to another person today, like some other accepted Stanford applicant, they compared themselves to who they were yesterday. And they grew. They matured. They became unique, interesting, memorable, and impressive.

You weren't rejected because you had low stats or bad extracurriculars. You were rejected because you were.....boring.

# Authenticity = Acceptance? Kinda.

Let's face it. Some people's authentic selves are simply boring. My ""authentic"" self is 99% composed of pedagogical philosophy. Bleh. If I was my ""authentic"" self on my application, I'd be reciting the words of Kant and Nietzsche all over my essays, over and over again. I would, without a doubt, be like the annoying little girl who bores her friends to death by talking about her crush over and over again.

I watched a couple of YouTube videos before and while I was applying, and there was a unanimous theme to them: be authentic. So that's what I did. In my essays, I talked about how fascinated I was with art and philosophy and introspection. But my application became....boring. Yes, I was fascinated with philosophy. Yes, I was being my authentic self. But it didn't make me memorable or interesting. And because I was too sheltered, too naive to truly reflect on my flaws and weaknesses, I became *even more* boring.

My common application essay I sent to Stanford was about walking. About what I think about when I walk for thirty minutes every day, and used it as a metaphor for destination. You can find all of my essays, including my common app, here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1otyVqRTWfjXcJa6WIM61sLIGFiUuHBc6QK1bDMDysWs/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1otyVqRTWfjXcJa6WIM61sLIGFiUuHBc6QK1bDMDysWs/edit?usp=sharing)

I realized after my rejection letter that almost my whole application-- *especially my common application essay--* was so fucking serious. Other than the roommate essay, I never cracked a joke or laughed or cursed or did the things that made me funny or interesting. After my rejection, I ended up rewriting my entire common application essay.....on bread. Yes. Bread. I cracked three jokes in that essay. For my Princeton application, I wrote a poem about my Dad's love of Drake. I did indeed utter the word ""ass"" in that poem.

So by April 1st, I'll edit this post to update you guys if my new insight helped me get into Harvard, Princeton, Yale, or Dartmouth. If I got into some of them, we'll know *for sure* that interesting > authenticity.

Now I know that all of you are going to say: what the hell, Robab! You're supposed to be *honest* in your application! Authenticity matters more than being interesting!

Well, duh. I'm not saying lie or be a fake bitch. I'm saying highlight the small, teeny endearing parts of you that make you interesting. Ask yourself: what do you talk about with your group of friends that makes your friends laugh? What makes them deeply interested in what you have to say? In other words, talk about your love of Korean television instead of your love of Immanuel Kant. No one is really that interested in hearing you talk about the latter.

# The Importance of Specificity

So here's my advice: to be interesting, first you have to stop caring about college, do the wild things that actually, genuinely interest you, and be a bit daring. Curse if that's who you are. Reveal your flaws and vulnerabilities. But after you do those things, the next best lesson is to be specific.  *Things that are interesting are inherently specific.* If a Stanford interviewer asks you, ""What do you like to do on your free time?"" and you say ""read books""....um okay....yeah maybe, but that's not specific. Everyone fucking likes to read. What if instead you said: ""I like to read books about the theory of justice"" or ""I like to read books about the economic effects on Russia caused by crippling deforestation"". Now...we're getting interesting. If an essay asks you, ""what do you care about and why"", don't say ""memes"". Fucking everyone likes memes. Instead, what about ""Kermit the frog memes, especially those where he's drinking Lipton tea""?

Okay, but now you're asking: Robab, how the fuck do I be specific. I'm not that interesting. I slouch on my couch and chew bubble gum all day.

Uhhhhhhhh. Can you maybe chill????

Here's how to be a specific self-reflector in five minutes: copy paste the questions down below into a word document, set a timer for 5 minutes, and answer each question in 5 minutes. The Rules? Don't delete or backspace anything you type (even spelling errors) and type as much as you possibly can under the time limit.

1. Describe your room. Why did you design it this way?
2. Describe why you like what you wear.
3. Describe what you eat for dinner.
4. Describe why you watch what you watch on YouTube.
5. Describe why you like your favorite book.
6. Describe why you like your favorite subject.

Then when you're done answering all the questions, review your answers. Does anything seem like it's so unique to you? For instance, on question 1, I wrote ""my black Michael Kors purse sits atop my black Ikea table next to a white bed and white dresser"". For question 3, I wrote ""I eat salmon and carrots and rice nearly every dinner and I like it because its healthy"". Now I know two broad things about myself: I love chic black/white design and healthy foods. Then I can specify in my supplements or essays why these things are unique to me: my whole room is filled with only black or white objects, and I eat ""salmon and carrots"" literally every day. These little details make me memorable. In fact, if you asked my friends to describe me, they'd say I'm a health freak and that if you wanted to spot me in a crowd of a hundred people, to look for the girl with the black Michael Kors purse and red coat. Because that's literally what I wear every. single. day.

And again: AdComs want people with interesting stories that make them human. Simply saying ""I value health and fashion"" or ""I love design and draw sketches of cars"" is too broad and describes many people. It's the small things that are descriptive and make you, you.

## The Interview

In your interview, be specific.  When the interviewer asks, “what would you do with 1 million dollars” most people say something like “donate to charity”.  This is amazing, but, *what charity?  Why that charity?  What makes you want to donate to charity instead of start a hedge fund?*  Furthermore, when they ask “if you were to teach a class, what would you teach?” don’t say “math” or “science”.  Be very specific, like: “I would teach a class on how transindividual power relations in a society change people’s behavior”. Again, these small details make you memorable, complex, and human.

# Teacher Recommendations

You want to pick teachers that fulfill as many of these characteristics as possible:

* They've known you really well. They even know the quirky, kinda awkward side of you. You should have talked to them for over two years in highschool and have gotten to know each other.
* They've written recommendations that get their students into great colleges, such as Stanford.
* They're known to be a fantastic writer (typically an English teacher is a phenomenal writer)
* They're a deep, thoughtful, and even possibly a philosophical and abstract individual, at least compared to your other teachers.

Here’s why:

* If they know you well, they will validate what you say on your application.  This is great, since Stanford probably ranks applicants on how well they reflect their personality by matching what they say about themselves to what others say about themselves.
* Recommendations that get kids into Stanford are usually a great indicator that the teacher is a strong recommender.
* If they like you and are a great writer, they will be a strong recommender.
* Deep, thoughtful teachers can probably see things inside you that you aren't be able to see within yourself. They add dimensionality and complexities to your application that make you seem more....*alive.*

*Don't* pick teachers simply because:

* You've known them the longest
* You have the best grade in their class
* They teach the field you want to major in, and you're afraid that if you pick a teacher who didn't teach you for a field you're passionate about it will look badly and incongruous in your application.

# AP Scores

I’d employ either one of two strategies in reporting your AP scores: (1) report all of the ones you got either a 3, 4, or 5 on, or (2) report only the AP subjects that matter to you.  Here’s why only reporting 5s is a bad idea: if you’re the typical kid like me with a good mix of 3s, 4s, and 5s, you may end up realizing that you got 5s on tests that didn’t matter to you and 3s on tests that mattered a lot to you.  For me, for example, I could have cared less about the Calculus (5), Psychology (5), and Statistics (4) classes/scores but I really valued my English Language (3) and World History (4) classes/scores (in fact, I was getting teacher recommendations from my English Lang and World History teachers).  If I just ended up reporting Psychology and Calculus, admit officers could have been confused as to what classes and scores I actually valued. So I encourage you to either be brave and submit all your scores, like I did, or send the ones that matter to you.

There's also a super easy way to study for AP tests. It's called Anki. People freak out about AP exams but if they have the right materials and the right mindset, they'll be okay. You need a focused mindset to study for AP exams, but you also need good materials. Anki is the best material you can ever have to study for anything. Not Barrons. Not Princeton Review. Not Kaplan.

Anki is a flashcard software you can download into your computer. It's based on cognitive science, and designed to maximize long-term memorization of information.

Listen: the reason most people do badly on exams is not necessarily because they didn't study, it's because they can't remember. Ever studied for ten hours for a test, or crammed three hours the night before, and still got an F? That's because you can't remember the information well enough to recall it during the exam.

To use Anki, you type up your flashcards for a specific topic, and then you go through them. After every flashcard, you ""rate"" how easy/hard it was to recall the information on the flashcard. Depending on how you rate it, Anki will then repeat the flashcard to you some variable time later. It keeps repeating it until recalling the information on the flashcard gets easier and easier. And once it gets easier and easier, you retain the information on the cards for longer and longer, up to several years if you study them often. If you use Anki, there's no doubt you can recall the information needed on AP exams, and will get 5s on them, no matter what prep book you use.

My experience with Anki? It took me from 3s and 4s on my exams to 5s. It took me from a 670 on my SAT Molecular Biology test to a 780 in two months. It brought my grades sophomore year from 6 As and 2Bs (taking 1 AP and 7 honors) to all 3A+s and 5As junior year (taking 6 APs and 2 honors).

The prep-book wasn't what I needed. It was Anki.

# And lastly: the GPA.

Your parents are gonna say it.  Your teachers are gonna say it. You’re gonna say it.  The whole world says it. But it’s wrong.

**You don’t need a 4.billion GPA to get into an Ivy League.**

Now admittedly, you do need a high class rank, most preferably the top 2%. Of course, class rank is not the best measurement for admit officers to see how much you can offer to a college, because every high school is different, and every class of seniors is different.  So what you *do* need is a weighted GPA of above 4.0, an unweighted GPA of at or above 3.75, and a class rank in the top 5-10%. And that's it.

Also, FYI: Stanford recalculates your GPA into their own scale called the SU6.  Essentially the SU6:

* considers only academic (not PE!) courses and
* courses taken after freshman year.
* To calculate the new GPA: A+=A=A-=4.0, B+=B-=B=3.0, etc.  Sum all them up and divide by the number of courses.

This SU6 helps admit officers calibrate all their candidates on the same scale, because some schools do 100.00 GPAs, some 5.00 GPAs, etc.

What GPAs did I have, you ask?

* Unweighted: 3.86
* Weighted: 4.29
* Class rank: 11% (like...50/470 something people?)
* Stanford’s SU6: 3.91

Thanks guys! Hope you can glean a lot of information from this post.  You can also find this post on r/GetIntoStanford. But always remember: if you stop caring so much about getting into college, and you start caring about things you actually like doing, you will get into the college of your dreams and be the best person you can be.

Peace be upon all of you. Good luck.

EDIT: (1) This is an opinion post, and though I don’t have sources, my speculation was gathered upon my experience and hearing the experiences of nearly a hundred other accepted Stanford students (either by DM, blog, YouTube, Instagram, or released documents/statistics by the university).  I, nor really anyone except AdCom, knows what really happens at the table.  (2) My essays in the attached link were read by about 10 Stanford undergraduates who said overall that they were very good, but needed tweaking, before submission.  I tweaked them accordingly.  You might read them and decide to believe otherwise.  (3) I am female.

Thanks for all the nice comments and support! I’m so glad I could help out.

562,hgccrb,False,Waitlists/Deferrals,43,I got trolled by Brown yesterday.,ApplyingToCollege,"Yesterday I got an email from Brown that said there was an update in my portal so I obviously logged into the portal as quickly as possible to find a couple of messages posted below the box where you can click on your status updates. The messages read ""An update to your application was last posted June 25, 2020. If you choose to accept this offer of admission to the class of 2024, you may not defer your entry date."" So understandably, I thought that the status update was going to read that I had gotten off the waitlist.

&#x200B;

But nope. I click on the status update and it makes it very clear that that is not the case and that in fact they are no longer considering my application. So I shoot the the admissions office an email asking for confirmation and turns out the portal was bugged and I had gotten my hopes up for nothing. 

&#x200B;

I'm not really upset at all really as I am content with where I am currently planning on going, but at the same time the ole bait and switch was kind of annoying, and if I *really, really* wanted to go to Brown, I would probably be super depressed and straight up pissed right now.

I’ve always been a science and math person, but I tried coding and it was boring af. I heard somewhere that it’s because there is high salary and demand, but this sub makes it seem like CS is a really competitive field.

Edit: I know CS is useful for most careers. Knowing Spanish and how to read/write are useful for most careers, but Spanish and English are a lot less common as majors. That’s not really the point of my question. I don’t get the obsession that this sub has with CS. I’ve seen rising freshman on here are already planning to go into it, but I haven’t seen that with really any other major.

564,d0ggwm,False,None,74,Ivy admissions are indistinguishable from a lottery,ApplyingToCollege,"I'm a mod of a sub that commonly gets the same question repeatedly misdirected to our sub, so I thought I'd address it here: How hard is it to get into an Ivy?

The answer is that, for your purposes as an applicant, Ivy admissions are indistinguishable from a lottery.  Getting a 4.0, good test scores, and all those great ECs are the equivalent of buying the lottery ticket.  Once you've got your ticket, all you can do is hope your name gets pulled randomly out of a hat.  

It's not actually random, of course, but it might as well be for all the control and visibility you'll have into the process.  There are so many qualified students applying for so few seats, the admissions offices are making decisions on differences so thin that they could split an atom.  You don't know what those factors will be any given week, much less any other year.  And you'll never know why you did or didn't get selected.

So, if this is the world you want to be in, buy your ticket and don't hold your breath.  If you get in, congratulations, you won the lottery.  If you don't get in, it's not because you're not good enough, it's because you weren't lucky enough.

&#x200B;

\#1: You have to know how to say NO. It is never a bad thing to have some fun while you're in college; you need to have those times where you can laugh and have a good time. However, you should not be partying and socializing 24/7. If you know you have an exam the next day that you need to study for, don't go out partying the night before. If you know you have that big essay due in a two days, don't go out and leave it until the last minute. Learn to prioritize.

&#x200B;

\#2: You have to study. This is a given, but I feel like many students do not take this seriously. During this school year, I took some difficult courses such as Anatomy & Physiology and Chemistry. Studying for 2-3 hours a week was not going to do me any good when there was so much material to cover. Take your studies seriously and study the material you need to learn. Removing distractions (phone, TV, etc) helped me focus on my studies as well.

&#x200B;

\#3: Interact your teachers. Take advantage of those office hours. Math was never my strong suit, so when I found out I had an 89.5% in college algebra, I was highly disappointed because I put in a lot of effort into that course. My college algebra professor and I had a good relationship, so when I talked to him about this, he gave me an easy assignment for extra credit that boosted my grade up to an A.

&#x200B;

\#4: Stay FAR AWAY from the drama and mind your own business. Drama always ends up making people feel down and more stressed than they already are. I know this one girl who had two boyfriends at once. The boyfriends ended up finding out, and made the girl's life a living hell, causing her to fall behind in her studies. This could all could have easily been avoided.

&#x200B;

\#5: Become aware of how you learn and retain information. For example, I love recording my professors' lectures and listening to them afterward. While listening to the recordings, I write and fill in my notes that I took during the lecture just in case I missed anything. This helps me retain a lot of information and perform well on tests because professors tend to say exactly what will be on tests during their lectures.

&#x200B;

570,ghsomi,False,Exams,362,AP Exam Tips!,ApplyingToCollege,"Just took the first AP Exam of the year! Here is all of the advice I’ve gathered and wish I had for myself:

1. If you are sending your images to yourself, like emailing them to yourself from your phone, do not reduce the image size. It can easily become illegible and your exam cannot be graded.

2. If your makeup request link does not work, put a / behind the ? in the url.

3. Your exam was submitted if it says “Your exam is complete.”

4. Not submitting a response is not a valid excuse for requesting a makeup, so if it comes to it, disconnect from wifi and cite connection issues as the reason for your makeup.

5. The second question (if there is one) starts immediately after the first.

6. If the exam says you have 30 minutes for a question, you actually only have 25 because the last 5 are meant for submitting your work. EDIT: what I meant to say was that the timer you are given in the exam includes the five minutes to submit work! You have to submit before the timer ends!

7. 5 minutes to submit is not as long as you think! Especially if you are working between multiple devices! Beware!

8. You have to log in at least 30 minutes BEFORE your exam! If it says the exam begins at noon, log in by 11:30 at least.

9. There are multiples versions of the exam. Don’t cheat. CollegeBoard is already scrounging Reddit’s and discord’s for cheaters. Don’t be one of them. Plus your teachers can mark you under the suspicion of cheating if they want. Don’t ruin it for yourself! You could even get rescinded from colleges!

That’s all I have, but please comment if you have anything else and I will add it to the post.

EDIT:

Some more tips:

10. From u/jjkite - Write your AP ID and initials on several sheets of paper before you begin so you don’t forget or have to do it last minute!

11. Please try the demo before you take your exam! Sometimes your phone may not save images as a jpg, for example, and you won’t notice until you are submitting with 30 seconds left :( (also sometimes an iPhone will save the image as HEIF, so be careful and try it out with the demo)

12. From u/-Paufa- - Print out one page summaries of your notes by chapter/unit, because you may overestimate the time you have to use resources. (Personally, I was already cutting it close when I only google searched a few things; very little time to go through your stack of notes/worksheets; definitely zero time to even think of cheating)

13. The browser does not lockdown your computer. That being said, do not hit back or refresh the page of the exam.

14. If your exam is heavily writing based, I would recommend typing up your answer and pasting it. If it includes a lot of scratch work and symbols, I would hand write it and upload photos.

15. Your answers are not auto-submitted. You must upload your files or paste your text, hit submit, then confirm your submission. Do not wait for the timer to run out, because it will only take your work if you press submit by yourself.

16. From u/throwaway143414 - You cannot upload images or files directly from google drive. Download them to your actual computer (so you can access them from files or file explorer) and then upload them.

If you are in the mix and have the stats and have a chance to afford it, you've got to apply. You owe it to yourself to take your shot and while you are likely to be rejected, you gave yourself a shot.

My father and I both graduated from MIT and my kids were hit hard when they got rejected, but they were in the arena and had a legitimate chance to make it. 1960s MIT was very different from 1980s MIT, which was very different from today's MIT, but I would have done anything to have my kids go there.

That being said, you shoot your shot and you make the best of where you end up. There is way too much emphasis on picking your 'fit' in advance. More emphasis should be placed on resilience and deciding that where you end up is the 'right' place. Lay your acceptances out in front of you and pick the best academic/financial/future prospects place for you and the \*decide\* that your choice will be your future.

Make it your place for success.

My son ended up transferring out of Purdue. My Daughter is navigating the virus at Michigan, but I am confident that they are both finding their way through the vagaries of life, starting in college. Life will never follow your plan. You are best served by picking your best option at the given time and planning to adapt to what life presents to you.

You have done well to be in the mix. Enjoy the excitement and then deal with the results. You'll be at a great place and its up to you to make the most of it!

576,eu7w5a,False,Meta Discussion,91,Underclassmen: STOP LURKING,ApplyingToCollege,"I totally get it. You’re aiming high, you’re nervous, and you want to be prepared, but for your own sanity you need to stay off A2C until you’re a senior. 

Here are my reasons:

1) A2C will stress you out. It’s full of mostly overachievers who are stressed out about very minor flaws in their application. (No shade, love y’all) You’re going to get the same mindset if you spend too much time on here and start to look at things that are actually positives as negatives. (Ex: instead of being happy you got a 32 on the ACT, you’re sad you didn’t get higher)

2) Burnout. The college admissions process is LONG. I started Apps in August, and will be doing scholarship interviews in March. (Not to mention all the tours I did my Sophomore and Junior year.) It is simply a fact that you are going to get burnout. But ESPECIALLY if you try to start the college process too early. 

3) It’s irrelevant. Like there’s so many underclassmen on this sub, but the vast majority of the information is totally useless to you. A thread about college interviews? You’ll have forgotten it completely by this time next you. Decision date for a school you’re not interested in? So what?? Problem with college portal? They’ll have fixed that glitch by this time next year.

4) Enjoy Highschool. Yes, highschool sucks, but that’s the period of your life that you’re in now. If you spend so much time worrying about and planning for college, you’re not going to take advantage of all the experiences highschool has to offer. Don’t spend so much time dwelling on the future that you forget to live in the present.

So when should you start?

A good rule of thumb is to not start your own college admissions process until the class above you has finished theirs. My advice would be to wait until after AP exams before you devote too much time to it, to avoid burnout.

In the meantime:

- participate in extracurriculars that actually mean something to you
- tour some colleges to get an idea about what you want in a school
- take classes that interest you and challenge you
- try to make the most of your highschool experience (it will be over quicker than you think)

To conclude, it’s awesome that y’all are putting in effort and care about your future, but do not cause yourself stress worrying about things that are a long way off. Make the most of wherever you are right now.

After many months, my friends and I are proud to present a preview of our upcoming game: ""Admission Revolutionnaire!"" All the writing, voice acting, music comp, and programming is by us. We've been working on this project as a sort of ""last hurrah!"" before we all part ways for college. It's our way of giving back and saying thanks to the a2c community for all the laughs and guidance over the last \~2 years. I've been a frequent (like x3 / day / every day obsessive) lurker, and I really owe my entire understanding of the application process to you guys. So thank you for being part of this community and making it the 🤡y place it is.

So..... what is *Admission Revolutionnaire*? It's what happens when you mash a dating sim with Ace Attorney, sprinkle a little bit of Majora's Mask on top, and resolutely adhere to your theme of making  an ""admissions"" based game.

\- The game begins Dec. 31. You have 72 hours to apply to all of your colleges! Luckily, your high school counsellor negotiated a special deal with the Elite Admission Officers. They’re letting you do 3 days of interviews *instead* of supplements!

\- The Elite Admission Officers are personifications of T20 colleges. Win them over by answering their questions favorably! Increase your chances of getting accepted to their school.

\- **Yale interview dating sim!!!**

\- Investigate the USC admissions scandal! With Paul Ledesma's help, you'll surely blow it wide open.

\- Cleaning your room before recording your Brown video interview minigame.

\- Spreadsheet-creating action. Portal link organizing.

\- A look into the life of CMC and her 4 twin sisters.

\- Last minute scrambling to get Princeton their graded paper.

\- ""Why does Columbia want NO context for why I love 'The Perils of Windmills In the Modern World'?""

\- Sit down with your AO and determine which hospitals are your viables and which are your reaches

\- Freaking out when you accidentally send Harvard a pdf that opens, ""Congratulations, your computer is equipped with a PDF (Portable Document Format) reader!"" instead of your real supplement.

\- And so much more!!! (including an original soundtrack and voice acting!)

If interested, to keep current with game updates, put in your email or phone number [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc9zS6YmHAOjW7ub-mnqEsW2p1kR5JlVk6YzxNG0oK2igA41g/viewform) and I'll  send you a message when there's news.

I really hope you guys enjoy this preview and my friends and I can't wait to share more in the future. If there's enough interest, we might launch a Kickstarter to help realize features we've conceptualized that aren't currently feasible... one of us just needs to be 18 first (which happens in about a week)!

Anyways, good luck over the next two weeks everyone! No matter where you all end up, I'm sure you'll do great! Thanks for making this subreddit so awesome. =)

590,hac2u8,False,Serious,52,A message to underclassmen: please choose the right friends.,ApplyingToCollege,"In light of me (finally) being a senior and starting college apps, I just wanted to put out a word of advice for any underclassmen out there. Please, please, please choose the right friends in high school. And I don’t just mean your typical “stay away from bad kids” advice. Choose people that will lift you up and motivate you in a POSITIVE way. 

I don’t know if it’s just me, but I barely ever hear anyone talking about how important it is to give yourself the correct type of motivation in high school. Imo, one of the biggest mistakes I made was filling my surroundings with negative motivation and not positive motivation. Friends are people who hype you up and motivate you to challenge yourself because *you feel confident*, not people who make you do something because *you feel incompetent compared to them*. It’s good to look up to people, but it’s super important to recognize that line where self-motivation becomes self-criticism ESPECIALLY in high school, where people can get super competitive and toxic. Chances are, if you feel like you’re playing a never-ending catch-up game and being put down for your class choice/grades/test scores, it’s negative for you. 

Unfortunately, the college application process is hyper competitive. That being said, look for friends who value having fun just as much as they value academics. Personally, I made the mistake of surrounding myself with people who cared about nothing but college admissions, and it made my junior year miserable. I was stuck prepping for AP exams all day and didn’t have any time to do, you know, regular teenage stuff. To this day I haven’t been to a single concert, gone to the beach with my friends, or gone on a shopping trip with them. This might sound silly, but trust me. Having fun in high school is just as important as studying and taking the SAT. Getting into an Ivy or T20 is not the whole world, and while it’s important to work hard/aim high leave some downtime for yourself too. 

That’s all I have to write for now. I realize that this might sound a bit cynical, but I just wanted to write this out and clear it off my mind before I start college apps. Peace ✌🏼

EDIT: Wow thank you for the upvotes and award! I didn’t foresee this happening, but thanks so so much.

EDIT: A second award?! You guys are really generous. Some ppl brought up really good points that I think are worth reiterating: As it is with basically everything in life, it’s important to find the right balance of both fun AND academics in high school. It can be hard to find the right people but never be afraid to branch out and have a mixture of acquaintances- don’t feel limited!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/hac2u8/a_message_to_underclassmen_please_choose_the/,1252,"It depends on the person.

591,fst2i9,False,CollegeBoard Discussion,43,CollegeBoard is the best organization ever. Here’s why.,ApplyingToCollege,"I just want to show my enthusiasm for this amazing new sponsorship for A2C. Here are my top 7(I have to go to bed soon so I can’t list all 696 reasons) on why CollegeBoard is the absolute best thing to happen to us.

1: They are a nonprofit. We know as fact that the $80 registration fees for the SAT and AP tests are put to good use. And the $800 million they earn each year is of course used for scholarships and other wonderful causes.

2: They provide an excellent test to determine our readiness for college. Scoring a 1600 shows my superiority over someone with a meek 1580. The only reason I didn’t get into Harvard was because I only scored a 790 in the SAT Gender Studies Subject Test.

3: AP courses are the best way to prepare us for college. Who cares if taking 13 AP classes in one year damages us psychologically? At least we’ll be ready to thrive at SUNY Ithaca.

4: They are brilliant for introducing curves onto a standardized test to help all of us out. -30 for one question in Math is an awesome implementation.

5: They reuse tests to save money, which is used for all the wonderful causes I mentioned earlier.

6: When they accidentally screwed up the June 2018 SAT, they didn’t refund anybody. In fact, they didn’t even apologize. This shows that they were too busy working on fixing the issue that they didn’t even have time to refund or apologize.

7: It’s so wonderful that we get to send scores to colleges directly from collegeboard! And it’s free, too, if you decide to send it before you actually receive your scores.

So there it is! CollegeBoard is the best organization I have ever encountered in my 18 depressing years here on this planet. A true non-profit, and I can’t wait for the amazing things they will bring to r/ApplyingToCollege .",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fst2i9/collegeboard_is_the_best_organization_ever_heres/,1258,"1600 over 1580?

Fortunately, people know that school prestige isn’t everything, but there is some misinformation regarding it for finance. 



School prestige DOES matter a lot for finance. This is due to the fact that you are in a client-facing role and you’d rather have an analyst from Wharton or Stanford representing you over someone from Penn State, all things being equal. While there are plenty that break in outside of the “target” schools, outside of students from UVA, Mich, Berkeley, Kelley, etc. You don’t see much from schools like Iowa or PSU.



This is somewhat of a cycle, as alums from targets prefer students from their school, but it’s not impossible to break in. That being said, if you’re looking for the easiest route into Wall Street, I’d consider taking on more debt to go to a “better” perceived school.



Edit: didn’t even get to mention top management consulting firms. If you’re shooting for MBB, if you don’t go to a target AND have a near perfect GPA and resume, you have almost no shot.

606,cae0j0,False,None,41,The year is 2080...,ApplyingToCollege,"The year is 2080 and you're a potato farmer. You live on a dusty piece of grey land in the middle of nowhere. Every now and then, you hear the *hum* of a motor. You look up into the grey sky, squint, and make out the all-too-familiar surveillance patrol. These flying drones, bolstered by advanced satellites, monitor every square inch of the planet. Just a single step across territorial lines? You're immediately shot on sight.

&#x200B;

Orwell was right. This is what our society has turned into--a dark, dystopian world. You and your poor family know it as the all-seeing Harvard. But it wasn't always like this.

&#x200B;

During the Alumni Uprising of 2061, arguably the greatest conspiracy in history, the heads of all the world's governments systematically took full control of their respective nations. Unbeknownst to the rest of the world, each one of them had, at one point or another in their lives, graduated from Harvard University. With an iron fist they clamped down on all forms of dissent and eventually consolidated society into a single global state. Originating from a mandate from John Harvard himself, the Uprising had been in the works since the early 1600s. The Harvard Alums established the Thought Police and slaughtered billions. Top scientists and government agencies from around the world unveiled previously-secret technologies that were centuries ahead of their time. This enabled the Harvard to expand its reach to virtually the entire globe.

&#x200B;

Now, you live a dreary life--on nothing but worms and repulsive protein blocks similar to those in the old classic *Snowpiercer*. Your tiny abode, made of only corrugated cardboard and true glue, collapses every other day. Despite the support you give your wife and children, they blame you. They blame you for something you did decades ago.

&#x200B;

In 2053, you were the epitome of perfect. You came from an extremely wealthy family and graduated with a 10.0 GPA. Cream of the crop. Heck, you earned a shattering 50 million dollars worth of scholarships. Elite colleges were practically on their knees begging for you to attend. In the end, you narrowed it down to Harvard and Cornell. What you did next sealed your fate. You chose Cornell. Retrospectively, by no means did it seem like a mistake; Cornell was ranked the number one university by US News and its programs were the best in the world. In fact, the first trillionaire had graduated from Cornell's class of 2024. You were so excited to be doing to such a prestigious institution. But, you would soon regret your choice. That regret would carry on for the rest of your life.

&#x200B;

Flash forward back to now. Each night as you tuck your daughter into bed, she hisses, ""If you'd chosen Harvard, we would've gotten full immunity from The Purge"". Then, as you tuck your son into his dirt cot, he reminds you that ""We'd be living in the skyscrapers of Pyongyang if it weren't for you."" And as you get into bed next to your wife, she would do what she always does. With the moon glinting off her striking eyes, she would glare at you for the rest of the night, unblinking, reminding you of the eternal pain and suffering you'd brought to your family.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/cae0j0/the_year_is_2080/,1241,"wanted to laugh but didn't because, at the rate we're going, in 2080 everyone posting in this sub, if they're still alive, will probably be living in a post-apocalyptic hellhole where the lower 48 united states are no longer habitable

613,dqi2tq,False,None,119,To everyone who applied ED to the same school as me...,ApplyingToCollege,"Genuinely, from the bottom of my heart: I hope you get in.

College admissions has turned into such a cutthroat affair. And I get it, to some extent, because I can understand the near desperation of wanting to attend your dream school. But I don't want this whole process to turn us into enemies. We're in this together.

We've all come this far. We all DESERVE to get in. I know that everyone's situation is different. We have different test scores and GPAs, different ECs, different financial situations; some of us have struggled quietly with mental illness and burnout while others have faced tough living situations and environments. Yet what unites us is that we've all done the same thing: worked our absolute hardest to get where we are now, to finish our applications, and to send them in. 

A lot of us will get rejected. But it's not because any one of us is better or worse than the other-- we all have our stories to tell, our scars to show, and stats alone can't possibly define us. It's just how it is with a competitive school! 

I'm prepared to not get in. I know I'd be happy at any of the other schools I've applied to. But I'm hoping and dreaming, and I'm doing the same for every single one of you! 

So in this time of stress and waiting, and the waiting joy and tears at the end of the line, know that I'm proud of all of us. We've gotten this far! And we'll continue to go far, no matter where we go. But let's hope it's to our dream school.

Love you all! We got this.

616,f939ya,False,None,99,I asked four of my friends about the worst moment from their alumni interviews.,ApplyingToCollege,"We all fuck up in interviews.

I personally have a few moments that occasionally keep me up at night. Not just from college interviews – I'm a bungling buffoon during internship interviews, debate tournaments, and class presentations. I figure, though, that I can't be alone. Haven't we all experienced that one cringeworthy moment, that instance of instantaneous embarrassment we so zealously yearn to retract? If you answer ""no,"" you're probably just not self-aware.

As such, I asked four of my friends about their interviews. Each of them are bright, talented, and entirely worthy applicants for their schools, but each can be a stumbling bastion of bumbling ineptitude at a moment's glance. Unsurprisingly, then, we all fucked up during our interviews. I rank them below in order of ascending stupidity.
_______________________________

**#4: Mixing up the Colleges** 

This guy's first choice was Duke, with Middlebury being a rather close second. These are, as y'all know, two very different schools with respect to location, athletics, and (especially) size. He had conducted due research on both, and emphasized components of each college which appealed to him. For Duke, he loved the large class size. For Middlebury, he loved the small class size.

The doofus forgot which college he was interviewing for. 

It went a little something like this –

**Doofus:** ""Middlebury's large size deeply resonates with me. I enjoy having several opportunities available to me on campus, and socializing with new people each day. I think it'll be integral to my college experience, and Middlebury offers just that."" 

**Interviewer:** ""Middlebury, uh, Midd's class size is about 2,500–""

**Doofus:** ""Exactly. But the breadth of opportunities available at Middlebury – their clubs, intramural and varsity sports, teacher-student interactions – makes it feel big. There's an opportunity for each student, the ability to explore several directions, hence why I say 'large size.'"" 

Honestly a remarkable save, in my opinion. He remarked that the interviewer bought it too, as they began talking about which clubs interested him. He got deferred from Duke ED and is waiting on Middlebury RD. 

**#3 Just a Terrible Answer** 

Interviewing for Vanderbilt. She said her interview was going smoothly enough, nothing remarkable but hardly any mistakes. Their conversation was winding down and she was handling the stereotypical exit questions, principally ""what do you look forward to doing the most at Vanderbilt?"" 

What would you answer? Probably something safe like engaging in Vandy's education training program, relaxing in the library, seeing the first snowfall, etc. Not her, though, for she is a nincompoop.

**Interviewer:** What do you look forward to the most at Vanderbilt?

**Nincompoop:** Attending one of the frat parties, putting myself out there... Vanderbilt's party scene is a major selling point.

**Interviewer:** Oh –– I was looking for something academic, but that's a unique answer.

Not too bad, but certainly not the ideal way to end an interview. She got accepted into Vanderbilt, though, so I guess something clicked.

**#2 Really Weird Wording**

This friend has a particular penchant for writing. He's able to string words together eloquently and impactfully, in a way where he invokes emotion. Sometimes, though, he misuses words or inadvertently creates really fuckin' weird pictures, as he did during his Dartmouth interview.

He said it was going pretty well, they were conversing about teacher-student relationships and the importance of accessible professors. We all attend a pretty small and progressive school, and routinely consult our instructors outside of class. So this lummox says:

**Lummox:** Maintaining relationships with my instructors is just indispensable for college. I feel Dartmouth has that. At [high school]... we have deeply intimate relationships that extend beyond teacher and student.

**Interviewer, thinking:** *this guy's gonna fuck every professor at Dartmouth* 

Rejected from Dartmouth ED. Guess the fertility rate in New Hampshire's high enough already. 

**#1 Insulting your Fucking Interviewer** 

Williams College up in Massachusetts has a pretty good XC program, believe it or not. This friend is ""the guy"" on our cross-country and track team, and he was interviewing with some Williams alumni. They got to talking about the athletics program at Williams, namely the success that their XC team had this year (they made nationals, I believe). 

I should add that his interviewer was a rather large woman.

Everything was going smoothly, he says, until this dunce whips out this gem:

**Dunce:** Running's a major part of my day-to-day life. Practice starts at 4:00, and it usually takes two hours between running, stretching, and weight training. But I love it – the competition, the drive to better yourself – it's just something I need to continue in college.

**Interviewer:** That's refreshing to hear, having a passion and sticking to it. I personally don't run–

**Dunce, smiling cordially:** Yeah, I can tell 

**Interviewer:**

**Dunce:**

**Interviewer:**

**Dunce:** I am so, so sorry 

The conversation continued awkwardly thereafter, and neither side brought it up again. I asked him just what the fuck he was thinking, and he had nothing. 

He did not get into Williams.

627,bauwu3,False,None,127,"Admissions Journey Timeline -- Looking at you, Rising Juniors and Rising Seniors (Updated Spring 2019)",ApplyingToCollege,"
[Link to u/LightningInADream's Post, ""Here's What I Learned The Hard Way."" with lots of his advice and advice from fellow seniors.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bah3y8/juniorsunderclassmen_heres_what_ive_learned_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

This is basically an abbreviated version of pretty much everything I say throughout the year; hopefully, it's organized in a way you can find useful.

Junior year is where your college admissions journey starts for real. Unlike freshman and sophomore year, you now have quite a few items to tick off your to-do list, but don't freak out if you're already a spring semester junior — or even a rising senior. You have plenty of time to get all this done.

Please note that my views about this might be different than the advice you hear from other sources or even other students. My philosophy is that it’s good to hear different thoughts and ideas, and then you can make decisions about what works best for you.

## Rising Junior Summer (Summer before Junior Year)

**GET INVOLVED WITH STUFF**

* Yourself (Exercise healthy habits, engage in personal hobbies and projects, READ real books, get a job, learn something new that’s good for your brains like guitar or Italian, practice mindfulness and meditation).
* Your family (Help with sibs or grandparents, grocery shopping, clean up around the house, or take care of dinner one night a week).
* Your community (Community service can be totally individual projects and/or organized group projects. Volunteer to play your instrument or play games at a retirement home, coach a kids’ team, make sandwiches at a food bank, or make comfort bags and drop off healthy snacks and water to the homeless).

**GET A SUMMER JOB:** Just an old-fashioned summer job. This will give you all sorts of skills you won’t gain by volunteering and also demonstrate leadership, diligence, a willingness to step outside your comfort zone. A summer job also shows determination and resiliency. Make some smoothies or scoop ice cream or fold sweaters. It really doesn’t matter what it is. Being responsible to a boss and customers for a paid job requires different skills than an unpaid internship.

**PRACTICE AND PREP FOR THE PSAT:** You take it in October, and it helps you qualify for National Merit if you score high enough.

**PRACTICE AND PREP FOR THE ACT and SAT:** Take a couple of practice tests and see which one feels better to you and which one you score higher on. Then move forward with that one. Consider taking one in December of the junior year. Definitely take one in the early part of the spring semester. It’s nice to have testing completed before you start senior year.

**TAKE SAT SUBJECT TESTS:** Especially if you are considering applying to highly selective schools. Take one or two in June or August that fit with classes you’ve just studied.

**ENJOY YOUR SUMMER:** This is super important. You need to take time to recharge your batteries. That’s part of being involved with yourself. Be sure to take some time completely off from school and college admissions stuff.

**START YOUR RESUME:** If you haven’t already, make a list of all the activities you’ve been involved in since freshman year. Keep in mind that basically anything you do outside of class time, homework, and test prep counts as an EC, so that includes old-fashioned summer or part-time jobs, home and family responsibilities, elderly and child care, personal projects and hobbies, and independent research, in addition to more traditional research, internships, and in-or-out-of-school clubs and sports. If you use the Coalition App, you can start on your application “locker.” Keep this list updated throughout the next two years. Create the following categories: Education, Extracurriculars, Work Experience, Community Service, Interests and Hobbies, Awards, Honors

**EXPLORE THE WORLD OF ADMISSIONS:**   Read some college admissions websites and blogs. Some of my favorites are Georgia Tech, MIT, Tulane, Harvard, and Tufts. They are open about the realities and anxieties of college admissions.

# Junior Fall

Pretty much all of the summer stuff applies still.

**TAKE THE HARDEST COURSE LOAD YOU CAN:** Colleges say that your course rigor counts for more than your GPA and test scores. Remember they evaluate you in the context of your school. So don’t worry about classes that aren’t offered. I recommend that you take four years of:

* Science (including Biology, Chemistry, and Physics)
* Foreign Language (many highly selective colleges like to see it. I know you don’t want to. It’s also good for your brain)
* English
* Math (ending in calculus if it’s offered -- or higher)
* Social Science (History, Gov, etc).

**GET TO KNOW YOUR TEACHERS:** Visit them at office hours. You will be asking them for teacher recommendations later. Speak up in class. Ask for help when you need it.

**KEEP UP YOUR GRADES:** I know you know this is the most important year for you as far as grades go. That said, an A- or B in a class isn’t going to kill your chances of going to college. In fact, there are hundreds of truly amazing colleges that are looking for B students. Just keep doing your work. Go to tutorials if you need tutorials. Meet with your teachers after class. Ask the smartest person in the class to tutor you if you need help. Watch Khan Academy and other Youtube videos if you’re struggling. Don’t wait and get far behind. Be proactive and start trying to bring up those grades now

**READ READ READ:** Reading will improve your test scores and your essay writing. Read real books, magazines, newspapers, and more real books. Read books that are required for school and books just for fun. I can suggest lots — just ask.

**KEEP PREPPING AND PRACTICING FOR THE ACT AND SAT:** Start testing in the late fall or early spring of Junior Year.

**STAY INVOLVED:** Keep up with everything I listed for summer. Also, get involved with your school. Join a club or two that interests you. Create a club if you don’t see one that interests you. Or simply do individual activities that add to your school environment. Sit with someone new at lunch once a week. Make an effort to say hello to two new people a week. Find a need and fill it. Or, as [this Georgia Tech blog says, ](http://pwp.gatech.edu/admission-blog/2019/04/12/which-activities-will-make-me-competitive/) find what makes you happy, and do it.

**CHECK IN WITH YOUR HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELOR:** See what they have to advise and how the process works at your school. Every school is slightly different.

# Junior Spring

**LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION:** Ask two or three teachers who know you best to write your letters. I encourage you to ask junior year teachers who teach you in core academic subjects. I prefer one from a STEM subject and one from a humanities subject, but some colleges have certain expectations, so be sure to read college admissions websites about what they are looking for. Ask your teacher in person or by email and then follow up either in person or by email. Be sure to include a basic info cheat sheet about you for them and a resume. Now’s the time to start thinking about which teachers you should approach for LORs.

LOR Cheat Sheet has your resume with your most important activities on it, and then it also has your answers to the following questions:

* What was your favorite part of the class?
* What was your most memorable activity or project
* What part of the class did you find most difficult?
* What did you learn that you will carry with you after class and why?
* Be sure to write a thank you note to the teachers who say yes.

**COLLEGE VISITS:** Start visiting colleges if you can. Look around in your city or town. Visit large schools and small schools. It doesn’t matter if it’s a college you think you might consider or not. Just go to start thinking about what feels right to you. Hang out on campus. Be sure to check out my new app, College Vizzy, and use it if you are visiting campuses to help make your visit more meaningful for you and to share your thoughts and experiences with those who can't visit. It's available in Phase 1 version on the app store now.

Then, if you can go on college visits to schools you might find interesting, do so.

* Be sure at this point to sign in and go on the tour and info session, but also wander around.
* Sit on a bench and eavesdrop on conversations. Do you like what you hear?
* Talk to students. Ask them what they’d like to change about their school. Or what they do on a Wednesday night. Don’t be shy. They remember what it was like to be a prospective student and, even if they are annoyed by your questions, who cares? They don’t know you and won’t remember you. Move on and find a kinder person.
* Check out the dining hall and the gym.
* Look for the area near campus where kids hang out if there is one. Lots of kids try to go on spring break trips to visit colleges if it’s affordable.
* If you can’t afford to visit out of your area, at the very least check out the colleges near you to get a feel for the kind of vibe that works for you.

**COLLEGE LIST:** Now’s the time to start coming up with your preliminary lists. If you can visit colleges, that’s the best way to learn about them, but also you can lot on the internet, social media, and by reading books.

* Reddit: A2C, colleges’ subreddits, and reverse chance mes.
* Colleges’ websites. Sign up to receive info and get on their mailing lists.
* Common Data Set.  Google college name and common data set.
* Colleges’ social media accounts. They are putting tons of info out there on Instagram, twitter, facebook, and snapchat. Clean up your account and use your real name and then you get brownie points for interest with those who consider demonstrated interest -- and it’s also super helpful to know more as you write your Why College essays! \*College Vizzy App
* Colleges’ newspapers and news feeds.
* [Niche.com](https://feeds.niche.com/)
* “Colleges that Change Lives” by Loren Pope (book and website)
* “College Match” by Steve Antonoff
* “The Best 382 Colleges” by Princeton Review
* “The FISKE Guide” by Edward Fiske
* “Insider’s Guide to Colleges” by Yale Daily News Staff
* “Where You Go is not Who You’ll Be” by Frank Bruni

**SOMETHING TO CONSIDER… Your SureFire Safety School** \-- Make sure you have at least one Sure-Fire Safety School and a selection of other colleges with a variety of levels of selectivity. A sure-fire safety school is a school where your stats, scores, and grades qualify you for automatic or direct admissions AND you would like to go there, AND they are a financial safety. Any school that does holistic admissions is not a sure-fire safety until you have been admitted. I like to see kids apply to a few schools with rolling admissions early on, so they can have that safety out of the way. You must LOVE your safety. Research it and imagine yourself there.

**COLLEGE FIT:** Start thinking about what you want in a college and compile a big old list. Having a ton of schools on this initial list is ok. As you explore yourself and the colleges more as you go through the admissions journey, you will naturally begin to filter schools out. This includes thinking about and potentially creating a spreadsheet for:

* *Financials:* Will you need full financial aid?  Will you qualify for any aid? Do you need full merit aid? These are crucial considerations. You and your parents need to spend some time thinking about this and going through net price calculators on various college websites. If you can’t afford the price of a school, it’s not a good fit.
* *Geography:* What areas of the country appeal to you? Open your mind here, too. I can’t tell you how many kids say no to the Deep South or Midwest without really thinking about it, and in doing so, deprive themselves of some excellent options and merit aid. Also, do you want urban? Do you want rural? Do you want an enclosed campus or one that’s incorporated into the cityscape? Do you want beaches? Mountains? Corn fields? Do you want to get out of your comfort zone here or stay with the familiar?
* *Weather:* Also important. If you really, really hate the cold, then moving to Boston or Chicago or Maine might not appeal to you. If you have to have four seasons, then the Midwest or the northeast might have good options.
* *School Culture and Vibe:* Are you looking for that stereotypical American big college experience with the big game on the weekends? Or are you looking for the quirky school? Or something that has it all?
* *School Size:* Do you want a big ole state school with loads of options? Or are you looking for something smaller or even mid-sized? Do you want discussion-based classes where you can develop strong relationships with your professors or are do you want to be in big lectures where you can take notes or go to sleep?
* *Potential Major:* If you don’t have one, don’t worry. You have plenty of time to figure that out, and it actually frees you up a bit. If you do think you know, research some schools that might be strong in your major. Maybe touch base with a professor or two.
* *Your Stats:* Where do your grades and test scores fit in? Are they right there in the middle? I like my students to be well above the 50% for most of the colleges they are applying to. This requires putting a lot of thought into what you want out of your experience and about who you are and who you want to be. It doesn’t require pulling out U.S. News \&amp; World Report and listing the top twenty schools.

**ADMISSIONSMOM'S COLLEGE BOOK CLUB:** (I don’t actually have a book club, just a list of books you should read.) Here are a few of the books I recommend:  *The Fiske Guide*, *Colleges that Change Lives*, and *Where You Go Is Not Who You’ll Be*, *Hey AdmissionsMom: Real Talk from Reddit*. See my list later in this post for a full list.

**COLLEGE RESEARCH SPREADSHEET:** Include info like test score averages, requirements, distance from home, school size, programs that might interest you, climate, and anything else you feel might be important. Email me ([dearadmissionsmom@gmail.com](mailto:dearadmissionsmom@gmail.com)) for the one I use.

**NO COLLEGE-TALK ZONE OR TIME:** Make a No College-Talk Zone or Time in your house. In my house, our kitchen table was a NO COLLEGE-TALK ZONE. That’s hard to do when you’ve got a mom who’s pretty obsessed with college admissions, but we worked at it. For other families I know, it might be all day on Sundays. This will help you and your parents keep your sanity during the next year. Otherwise, your house and family will be consumed with talking about college admissions from dawn to dusk in every room in your home for the next year. That’s not healthy for any of you.

**NET PRICE CALCULATORS:** Sit with your parents and do the net price calculators at a few colleges. Begin the financial conversations.

**NEW COLLEGE EMAIL ADDRESS:** Make a new college-only email address to use for college applications and communications. Make it appropriate! I recommend this because then all your info from colleges won’t get mixed up in your other emails. I encourage you to allow your parents to have access to it if you feel comfortable with it. Be sure to check your junk, trash, and spam inboxes, so you don't miss important info!

**CHECK IN WITH YOUR HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELOR:** They have a lot of knowledge and can guide you along the way. And they will be writing about you. If you haven’t stopped by to meet them yet, now’s the time. Keep in mind that every high school might have their own processes you need to follow.

**COLLEGE INFO SESSIONS:** If a college comes to your town or close to your town or school, go listen. Make sure you sign up and sign in.

**COLLEGE FAIRS:** Go to them! Talk. Ask questions. Learn.

**WRITE:** I know you hear so much about the Terrifying College Essay…. But guess what? It’s not! Even the timidest of writers begin to like writing the college essay and experiencing the soul searching. My advice is a little different than most college essay coaches and counselors in that I don’t think you should start working on your essays too early. I DO think you should practice writing. Here are my tips for getting ready to write killer college essays.

* Write Every Day. Even if it’s just a sentence or two.
* Read and listen to essays on [www.thisibelieve.org](http://www.thisibelieve.org). These aren’t college essays, but there are hundreds of amazing personal essays about all sorts of subjects. I like that they aren't college essays.
* Check out [www.collegeessayguy.com](http://www.collegeessayguy.com), and start perusing his stuff. His website is brimming with tips, hints, and suggestions about writing college essays.
* Practice just writing in your voice--like you’re writing to us here on reddit. Admissions counselors want to get to know you in your essays, not be impressed by you. Your application with your shiny stats and activities is for impressing. Your essays are for expressing.
* Try to avoid reading college essays or “essays that got in.” There is no set formula or way to write these essays, and when you read those, then you get trapped in the “this is what a personal essay should look like” mindset. It’s not pretty, and it causes you great amounts of stress and, quite frankly, a lot of repetitive, boring essays for the reader. I can’t tell you how many essays I’ve now read that start with “The sweat dripped down my brow as I (tortured my way through the math exam, debate tournament, community service project, track meet…..” You pick). I will be writing a lot more about what I feel like you need to do for strong personal essays and supplements. \*I’ll be happy to share my essay resources with you. Email me at [dearadmissionsmom@gmail.com](mailto:dearadmissionsmom@gmail.com).

**READ BOOKS:** Seriously, reading is the best way to write well, write deeply, have good interviews, and be prepared to do your standardized testing. You should make yourself read every night or day. Even for just five minutes. Reading good fiction and also self-help books will help you learn to discover your voice. Here’s a list of fantastic books to read. Some are just for fun, and others help with stress, but all of these writers have a strong voice in their writing, and you feel the person on the other side of the page. That’s an important skill to think about as you prepare to write your personal essays.

**TAME THE ADMISSIONS STRESS MONSTER:** Dealing with your stress as you go through this next year is key. There will be times you feel overwhelmed, frustrated, angry, and sad. So, how do you deal with it? What do you do? Besides post and comment on a2c??? :))

* Be involved. And be involved for you and what you want and like to do, not just to create a list for your apps. The kids who are the most disappointed and stressed out are the ones who feel like they’ve sacrificed their lives for their college apps.
* Get a job. This might be a good time to get a job and start saving money for the things you will need in school. An old fashioned job where you earn just a little but learn a lot from the experience of taking care of customers or working with others who might never have the chance to work with is invaluable at this time. It also can help you with time management.
* Practice gratitude 🙏. Make a daily list of things you are thankful for. Even during all your stress, what is good? Are you happy for air conditioning or heating? Are you grateful for ice cream? Or for that amazing teacher who sparked something in you. There’s nothing too small here, but when we stop and think about it, it can take away some of the anxiety and stress.
* Be like Elsa and Let. It. Go. If Disney Cartoons aren’t your style, maybe this story about monkeys and coconuts will resonate. Hunters attach a coconut to a tree, cut a hole in it, and place a banana 🍌 inside. A monkey comes along and puts his hand through the hole and grabs the banana. The unfortunate thing is the hole is too small for his fist to get back through, so he is stuck sitting by that tree holding on to the banana. To be free, all he has to do is let go of the banana.
* Horses with flies. This is a silly one, but it can help! So, you know how horses make their skin quiver when a fly lands on them? That’s what you do here. It’s a super quick tension reliever. First, shake your hands, then your arms, then your head, then your feet, and your legs, and your belly. Raise your hands high over your head while shaking, and then quickly drop down and reach for your toes and come up. Make sure you make a silly noise when you drop down! Then, feel how alive your body feels and pay attention to that smile on your face!
* LEAN IN.  Lean into your fear, frustration, anxiety, and stress. Right now this is what it is, so tell it to come on in. Sometimes, just saying that makes it ok. It is knowing that this is just what’s happening right now and it’s ok. It’s ok to be stressed and worried. It’s normal. Don’t try to run away or suppress it. Lean in and face it and embrace it. Think about it. Assess it. If something is making you afraid, that can often be an indicator that you’re doing the right thing! I know this drives some of you up the wall bat-shit crazy when we say it, but remember this experience is so much about the journey and not the outcome. And you will learn more about yourself from any perceived “failures” or disappointments than acceptances to a particular school. It’s true. It pisses you off when we say it, but it’s true.
* Mindful Meditation. Take three minutes every day and focus on your breathing. That’s all — no need to clear your brain. Just focus on your breath. Be mindful of what’s happening to you. Is your mind wandering? Cool! That means you’ve been successful with your mindful meditation because you discovered that your mind had wandered away from focusing on your breathing. It’s no biggie. Just come back to your breath. This is such a simple practice, and so many people get caught up in the “I could never clear my brain. Or I can’t relax” part, but that’s not what it’s about. You don’t have to clear your brain or relax. There are no rules. Just focus on your breathing for three minutes. It’s that simple.
* Move. Exercise. Go outside. Get Fresh Air. Eat Healthy Food

**OTHER…** If you are a low-income applicant, I want you to be aware of and explore these amazing programs and possible options, if you’re not already:

* Questbridge Program:[ https://www.questbridge.org/](https://www.questbridge.org/)
* Jack Kent Cooke Foundation Scholarship Program:[ http://www.jkcf.org/scholarship-programs/](http://www.jkcf.org/scholarship-programs/)
* The Posse Foundation:[ https://www.possefoundation.org/](https://www.possefoundation.org/)

Juniors, you are in for the journey of your life. By this time next year, you will know far more about yourself than you ever thought possible. Keep in mind that failure, disappointment, frustration, and feelings of being overwhelmed are all part of this journey -- just as much or maybe even more so as the excitement, anticipation, and dreaming. Every stumble, and bump in the road will make you stronger.

I'm looking forward to watching your transformations; you got this! This is a prime opportunity for you to take advantage of digging in and getting to know who you are. Instead of focusing so much on getting in, let’s instead focus on getting inward.

# Rising Senior Summer

What to do? What to do? This is an important summer for you, but there is no magical formula of what you need to or have to do to get into any colleges-- even the most highly selective ones. Sure, you can research in a lab ( you get those positions by emailing any and every professor you know or who you can find doing research you’re interested in). Or you can get an internship (you get those the same way as research). Or you can do a program somewhere on a campus or around the world. Those are all great ways to spend your summer. You can also do independent projects. But, don’t forget the good old fashioned summer job. You can actually stand out from the applicant crowd these days by making a smoothie, flipping a burger, or scooping ice cream. These kinds of job allow you to learn about taking care of others and listening to what the customer wants, learn about organizing your thoughts and activities, learn to work with others and gain some experiences you might never have the chance to gain again.

Here’s what William Fitzsimmons, Dean of Harvard Admissions, says about summer: “Bring summer back. Summer need not be totally consumed by highly structured programs, such as summer schools, travel programs, or athletic camps. While such activities can be wonderful in many ways, they can also add to the stress by assembling “super peers” who set nearly impossible standards. Activities in which one can develop at one’s own pace can be much more pleasant and helpful. An old-fashioned summer job that provides a contrast to the school year or allows students to meet others of differing backgrounds, ages, and life experiences is often invaluable in providing psychological downtime and a window on future possibilities. Students need ample free time to reflect, to recreate (i.e., to “re-create” themselves without the driving pressure to achieve as an influence), and to gather strength for the school year ahead.” link is here:[ https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/preparing-college/should-i-take-time](https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/preparing-college/should-i-take-time)

**Finish up testing.** SAT, ACT, and subject tests

**BE INVOLVED** (see above)

**RECHARGE YOUR BATTERIES:** Take time to care for your mental health and your body. Learn more about meditation, mindfulness, or yoga. Get outside and walk or run. Listen to music. Have dance parties in your room. Breathe. Listen to books or podcasts. Hang out with friends.

**WRITE:** “Write like a motherf\*cker,” as one of my favorite writers, Cheryl Strayed says. Write about yourself. Don’t worry too much about the essays just yet. Just write. Everyday. Get used to your voice. See my WRITE from Junior Spring. Figure out who you are.

Email me ([dearadmissionsmom@gmail.com](mailto:dearadmissionsmom@gmail.com)) and ask for my list of questions to get you going. This will help you get that Personal Statement ready to go by October 1. Use this super cool app/website that some of the A2C kiddoes have taught me about-- [www.the](http://www.the) mostdangerouswritingapp.comStart asking yourself some hard and kinda silly questions. You can practice answering these in themostdangerouswritingapp.com! I’ve had students write stunning essays just by answering these questions:

* What do you think about when you wake up in the morning?
* What do you worry about?
* What’s your secret sauce?
* What’s your superpower?
* What’s the last thing you think about before you go to sleep?
* Who are your role models and why?
* What’s your favorite comfort food?
* When you’re in your room at night, what do you look at?
* What makes you smile?

**THINK ABOUT AND PRACTICE WRITING THE PERSONAL ESSAY:** Remember — no matter which prompt you choose or which kind of vehicle or conceit you use to relay your message — the topic is YOU. Focus on teaching the admissions officers about who you are. Don’t worry about being unique; worry about who you are. Don’t worry about standing out; worry about sticking with the reader. You do that by creating connections and bonds. Those are created by opening yourself up and letting them inside. Let the reader know what’s happening inside you. They want to know what you think about, what you believe, and what you value. They don’t need to hear a whole lot more about what you’ve already told them in other areas of your application. Focus on More Expressing, Less Impressing.  I'll be happy to share my essay resources with you, including the essay chapter from my new book, ""Hey AdmissionsMom: Real Talk from Reddit"", if you email me at [dearadmissionsmom@gmail.com](mailto:dearadmissionsmom@gmail.com).

**MAKE A COMMON APP and COALITION ACCOUNT:** Start filling out the details like activities, family info, and educational background.

**UPDATE YOUR RESUME** (Or create it if you haven’t done so yet.): see description above

**VISIT COLLEGES if you can:** see description above

**START YOUR COLLEGE LIST:** Start narrowing down your list — including a wide range of selectivities. Make sure you have at least one SFSS (SureFire Safety School). What is a SureFire Safety School you ask? As a reminder, a SureFire Safety School is often your most important school. It’s one:

* where you have direct/auto/guaranteed admissions based on your stats
* OR you’ve already been admitted via ED, EA or Rolling
* AND you can see yourself being happy there
* AND it works financially for you and your family.

**KEEP IN TOUCH WITH COLLEGES:** Sign up to ""request info"" from every college you’re interested in — even if you’re already getting info from them because they bought it from a testing company. Also, I recommend that you follow the admissions offices on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter for the colleges on your list or potential list. They often put out a lot of helpful information for what's happening in their offices. I suggest following the Common App, too. Also, it’s totally ok to occasionally contact your regional college admissions officers or the general front desk with questions.

# Senior Fall

All of the above....plus:

Finish up any **college visits especially for EARLY DECISION POSSIBILITIES.**

**COLLEGE LIST:** Begin to narrow your college list. Make sure you have one or two SureFire Safeties (see above) that you love and that will be good financial fits, as well as a collection of matches, reaches, and lotteries (if that’s your thing).

**COLLEGE APPLICATION SPREADSHEET:** Make a spreadsheet for all your colleges. Add application deadlines. Supplemental Essay topics — and look for overlap. Testing info. Contact info for your regional officer. Email me ([dearadmissionsmom@gmail.com](mailto:dearadmissionsmom@gmail.com)) for a spreadsheet.

**FILLING OUT APPLICATIONS:** Start with the details if you didn't do it in the summer. Fill out activities, family history, etc.

**EARLY ACTION:** Try to apply to as many schools by Early Action as are available. Make a calendar of deadlines and essay requirements and work through them one by one.

**FAFSA AND CSS:** Make accounts and start gathering and filling out information.

**FINANCIAL AID:** Reach out to the financial aid offices of schools on your list and establish a relationship with them.

**LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION:** Check back in with your recommenders. Send them a reminder email and stop by if you can. Be sure to give them a big thank you! (Also give them a resume and ""cheat sheet"" if you haven't yet.)

**YOUR HIGH SCHOOL GUIDANCE COUNSELOR:** Check in with your guidance counselor or college counselor if you aren't in regular contact. They have a lot of knowledge and can guide you along the way. And they will be writing about you. If you haven’t stopped by to meet them yet, now’s the time. Keep in mind that every high school might have their own processes you need to follow.

**SAT/ACT/SUBJECT TESTS:** Finish up any testing you have left to do. Be sure to check colleges’ websites for their last accepted testing dates. 

**SUBMIT TEST SCORES:** Submit your test scores in plenty of time for deadlines to the schools who don't allow self-report. Be sure to check the colleges’ admissions websites to find when they need to be submitted. 

**ESSAYS:** Start writing your essays for real now. Focus first on your Personal Statement. Then categorize your supplemental essays by due dates. How many Why College Essays do you have? When's the first one due? Then, organize the Why Major Essays and the Extracurricular Essays. Think about whether you want/need to write an Additional Info essay. And then group the others. Try to get the Personal Statement done by October 1.

**INTERVIEWS:** Be sure to check your email (and voicemail and trash and spam folders for interview invitations). Every school has a different method for signing up, so read the website carefully. Some you are automatically signed up. Others require you to sign up yourself. In most cases, they are optional and sometimes you might not be given the opportunity. Don’t worry (as long as you’ve checked your trash and junk mails). I do suggest that you do them though — even if they’re optional and you’re nervous. Lean into your fear, admit it to them, tuck in your button shirt, comb your hair and wash your face, and go.

**LOCI:** If you are deferred Early Decision, be sure to write a LOCI (Letter of Continued Interest).

## Senior Spring

**FINISH UP APPLICATIONS:** Add any schools to your list that you need. There are plenty of colleges still accepting applications throughout the spring (and summer).

**SUREFIRE SAFETY SCHOOL:** Make sure you have a SureFire Safety School. If you don't have one yet, look for good fits for you that are still accepting apps. Read above to see what that is if you don’t yet.

**KEEP THOSE GRADES UP:** Being rescinded for grade drops is a very real thing.

**TAKE TIME TO CARE FOR YOUR MENTAL HEALTH AND YOUR BODY:** Learn more about meditation, mindfulness, or yoga. Get outside and walk or run. Listen to music. Have dance parties in your room. Waiting for those acceptances can be brutal. Breathe. Acknowledge that once those little baby applications have flown away from your computer, you no longer have control.

**EMOTIONAL PLANNING:** Plan for the worst, but hope for the best. Recognize that many colleges you might be interested in are extremely selective, and even if they're not, they might be holistic. Don't get too connected to any college except for your SureFire Safety. Keep in mind that there are far too many amazing yous to fit into the tiny teacup of colleges you’re all trying to squeeze yourselves into.

**GRATITUDE:** Think about what you are grateful for. What are the good things in your life? Try to make a mental list every day. Be sure to write thank you notes to all those who have helped you along the way: counselors, teachers, parents, admissions officers, and interviewers to name a few.

**ENJOY THESE LAST FEW MONTHS OF HIGH SCHOOL:** Connect with friends and family.

628,aclutj,False,Best of A2C,107,Up Close and Personal: The Interview. Here's my Interview Cheat Sheet.,ApplyingToCollege,"I'm seeing that lots of you are getting invited to interviews and have questions about whether you should do them or not, or what they are all about.  

**Do the interview.** Data for some schools shows a striking difference in acceptance rates for those who interview and those who don’t if the opportunity is available to them. So, if the school offers you an interview, it’s in your best interest to accept. That’s even if they say that the interview is technically “optional” (you do know that there is no such thing as truly ""optional"" in college admissions language right?).

Lots of schools have different methods for the way they conduct interviews, so you need to **read their websites carefully.** For some, you are automatically put on an interview list when you apply. For others, you have to sign up and arrange it. Additionally, at some schools, they will automatically add you to a list for an off-campus interview if they have them available in your area. 

**Interview time is also an excellent time to start regularly checking your inbox for communications, as well as your spam and junk folders, and make sure you have your voicemail set up and cleared out on your phone. You don’t want to miss any communications from the college** (which you should be opening for demonstrated interest reasons), especially not for something like an interview. Note — one of my own children missed a couple of interviews because he wasn’t checking spam. It was definitely a lesson learned the hard way.

# Advice for nailing the interview

It’s easy to become anxious and stressed about interviews, especially if you’re in the midst of the interview swamp right now. It’s fun, but can be a little sticky, and gooey, and uncomfortable. Or dry and desert-like maybe. Or maybe even moist and dessert-like.

Regardless, you can do this! You’ve made it this far, having surmounted obstacles like grades, extracurriculars, and putting together your application. So instead of stressing, focus all that nervous energy into what you can do right now: prepare.

## Top Ten Potential Questions They Might Ask You

You shouldn’t memorize your answers to these questions, but it won’t hurt to think a little about your answers. Focus on how these questions can help you authentically present yourself, not how you can make yourself seem like the most impressive, perfect candidate of all time (the interviewer will see right through that). 

1. “Tell me about yourself.”
2. “What do you like to do in your free time?” Follow-ups: Be prepared to talk about some of your extracurriculars and why you enjoy them, how you got interested in them, etc. 
3. “Why X College?” Follow-ups: Here you should have specific details — amazing classes or professors or programs you’ve heard about. What first drew you to this college and why do you think you’re a good fit? What will you contribute?
4. “Why do you want to study X?”
5. “What are your strengths and weaknesses?” As follow up: What do you do to remedy those weaknesses?
6. “Describe yourself in 1-3 words.” Some say one. Some say three.
7. Be prepared to talk about “supplemental essay” questions: 
   1. Your favorite X (author, mentor, person, etc.)
   2. An obstacle in your life you’ve overcome
   3. What has influenced you the most in your life
   4. Talk about a time when you had to resolve a conflict
   5. Talk about a time you’ve demonstrated leadership, etc.
8. What are your plans after college? You don’t have to be super specific — maybe say what field you’re generally interested in, and perhaps offer one or two ideas you have in mind and why.
9. “What would you do differently about high school if you had to do it again?”
10. “If an alien offered to take you on an epic space journey, but you could never see your friends and family on Earth again, would you go?” (In my experience, sometimes interviewers like to throw weird or unexpected questions at you just for fun.)

## Preparing for Your Interview

In the days leading up to your interview, instead of preparing and memorizing whole paragraphs to lob at the interviewer, think about why you love the school so much. What is it that you love? Because what you love is the version of “you” that you see there. And “you” will be wherever you go. Figure out how you fit that school (it all comes back to fit!).

I suggest bringing a one-page resume. There are others who disagree with me, so go with your gut, but if the college or the interviewer doesn’t explicitly tell you not to bring a resume or anything, I recommend bringing a one-page highlights resume. This way the recommender has something to refer to as they talk to you and as they later write their notes. Simply hand it to them when you meet them. If they toss it to the side or say they don’t need it, no biggie.  See below for my one-page resume suggestions.

Also, bring a notepad and pen so you can take notes if you like. 

The night before the interview, do the basic but essential preparation stuff — make sure your outfit is clean, pressed, and ready to go. Check out the route to the interview location to anticipate transportation challenges and make sure you make it on time. Go over the next day’s schedule and make sure you’ve given yourself enough time to get to the interview location and get into the right frame of mind. Get a good night’s sleep. 

## Making a Good First Impression

**Appearance**

Contrary to what some students believe, you do not need to wear a suit to your interview. But you must have a tidy, neat appearance.

For example, you could wear a clean shirt with a collar, tucked in, and a clean pair of pants or jeans with a belt (if you have pants other than jeans, wear them). You could also wear a clean skirt or pants with a blouse or shirt, tucked in if appropriate. Or you could wear a nice dress (but nothing too fancy). Wash and brush or comb your hair. No need for anything too elaborate, clean and neat hair is fine. Shave or trim your beard, if you have one, so it looks controlled. If your hair looks a little messy and you think you need a haircut, well, maybe get a haircut.

Wear something you are comfortable in, and that makes you feel confident. However, DO NOT WEAR inappropriate t-shirts or dirty, stained, or torn clothes. Avoid t-shirts, hoodies, and ripped jeans if you can — even if they tell you it’s casual. If you wear tennis shoes, make sure you clean them up. Also, I personally feel like you should take out any piercings beyond ear piercings, but maybe that’s just me being old-fashioned and frumpy *\[AdmissionsSon’s note: yes, that is definitely you being old-fashioned and frumpy, though unfortunately many interviewers are also old-fashioned and frumpy. Students, try to gauge your audience a bit with this one. I’d be totally cool with whatever piercings.\]*

**Arrival**

Arrive early, so you don’t stress yourself out rushing to the interview. Plan how early you need to leave to arrive 15 minutes early, and then leave 15 minutes before that time. So yes, you might be 30 minutes early. That’s ok. When you get there, go to the bathroom. After you take care of your business, look at yourself in the mirror and put your hands on your hips and stand up nice and tall. Do the Superman Pose and take some deep breaths.

**Introductions**

Smile! Don’t force a big fake smile, but you’re not at a funeral, right? Again, the interview is going to be like a little chat between you and the interviewer. You might as well relax and try to enjoy it a little bit.

Make eye contact. This is very important. Make sure you look the interviewer in the eye, so they know you’re engaged and paying attention. But like, not too much. It’s not a staring contest. Just be confident but natural. 

Introduce yourself. The easiest and most casual, confident way to do this is to simply state your name during the handshake.

Shake hands. Think of a good handshake as about the degree of firmness you would need to hold onto a doorknob to open a door.

## During the Interview

Put your phone away.  Silence it and tuck it away. Don’t take it out again until after the interview. The only exceptions would be something like they ask to see a picture of an art project you did and you happen to have one on your phone. If you do show them a picture, make sure there’s nothing potentially embarrassing to scroll past!

Remember to breathe.

Listen to your interviewer. The one piece of advice that the Admissions Counselors for Colleges ask us to share with you is for you just to come and listen to the questions and respond. Don’t come with an agenda of what you want to say or come off as overly practiced. They could end up noting that in their write-up.

Being nervous is ok. Own it. Many of you are shy and introverted. Lean into your nerves. You can tell the interviewer. They might be too, and this will help them know to help you along. Your interviewer’s not looking to catch you in an awkward moment or waiting for a mistake to pounce on. They don’t want you to fail.

## After The Interview

Ask for a business card so you can write a thank you note to your interviewer! When you get home after the interview, jot down a quick thank you note and send it in. Here’s a good rule of thumb — if your interviewer is your parents’ age or older, a hand-written thank you note will be great if you have his or her home address (without creepy internet snooping); otherwise, an email is fine. Be gracious, be grateful for their time, and be sure to bring up something they talked about in the email. Don’t worry if you don’t hear back from them. It doesn’t mean anything at all.

**THE RESUME**

In most cases, the interviewer, especially if they are an alum interviewer, won't have any heads up about your application, so this gives them something to work through.

HEADING: Your full name, ID # for that school, email address, cell phone number, and home address 

EDUCATION: High School (s), GPA, SAT, ACT, SAT Subject, and AP or IB scores if they are helpful (note-i had a redditor tell me last week that some schools want to be sure you don't include your GPA or test scores. I'd never heard that before, but obvy if they say that to you, then leave that part out)

EXTRACURRICULARS: what do you do outside of school? It doesn’t have to be a school organized activity.

Obviously, this is you distilled into one page, so brevity is key. They may or may not look at the resume, but that’s ok. You just hand it to them when you get there. Some will politely set it aside or just say they don’t need. Others will refer to it and use it for notes. It’s out of your hands once you pass it to them.

**INTERVIEW NO-NOs**

Don’t treat the interview as the magical ritual that will automatically get you admitted to the school of your choice. As stressed above, this should be a conversation, not an audition, not a monologue. You need to treat your interviewer with respect. Above all else, you need to let your best self shine through.

To achieve that goal, avoid these common interview mistakes:

* Arriving late
* Wearing dirty, torn clothes
* Having your phone out/Looking at your phone
* Offering a limp handshake 
* Being over-prepped
* Spewing canned answers that sound like you’ve tried to memorize them
* Coming with an agenda of what you want to or think you should talk about
* Not listening to the interviewer! The number one thing admissions officers and alums tell me to tell students is to LISTEN in interviews. They say far too many students come with rehearsed responses and you are not actually listening and responding to the questions presented to you. Listen. Be present. Smile. Engage. Breathe.

# 

# tl;dr

* Whatever it looks like, an invitation for a college admissions interview is awesome! It’s an excellent opportunity to have one-on-one and personalized contact with the school, and it adds a lot of useful information to your application.
* There are different ways to get an interview — you might be invited, or you might have to sign up. Keep an eye on your email inbox (check spam and voicemail too) and read the admissions page website for more information!
* Don’t be upset if you don’t get a ton of interview requests, or if you don’t get any at all. Lots of kids get into amazing colleges without an interview.
* Don’t overthink your interview performance. That means you should not memorize answers ahead of time. 
* Before, during, and after the interview, put your best foot forward. Look clean and neat, be attentive and polite, and send a thank you note afterward. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/aclutj/up_close_and_personal_the_interview_heres_my/,1213,[deleted] ,2019-01-04 19:47:56

632,a8zz9n,False,Best of A2C,155,WilliamTheReader: What Your Essay Looks Like From the Other Side + Crucial Essay Advice,ApplyingToCollege,"Hi guys, first some housekeeping. I hit the 1,000 essays reviewed mark a week ago and am now closer to 1,200. **Definitely send me essays through direct chat**. We tried messages and I just can't make sure I get everyone in my inbox. Also, I am trying to get to everyone but I really underestimated the response from everyone. Sorry if I missed you, just direct chat me. I'm trying to juggle full-time work and also the wonderful clients that hired me privately for admissions consulting (who I've really been focusing on).

&#x200B;

I have realized something. **Many of you have been really overrating the quality of your essays, or you just have no idea what top colleges are looking for**. This is concerning to say the least. So, as the deadlines are approaching, I want to give some insight on how essays are actually evaluated. This is critical advice that I'm not seeing anywhere else on the internet, and it comes mostly from my experiences on the other side of the table as an AO. **The main takeaway is that essays are the single most important factor on your application,** excluding outside factors you can't control (race, HS, hooks etc.)

&#x200B;

The first thing you have to understand is that there is only one universal goal that a top admissions essay has to accomplish: to make the AO like and root for you on a personal level. No other universal rules exist. That is the only guiding principle, everything else is dependent on the AO that reads your app. Think about it from our perspective. First, we need to get all the ""required"" kids in. So immediately, 30-40% of our class is filled from all the athletes/special kids/legacies/feeder school kids. You could argue that URMs have their own quotas as well. Once we have those, there is no reason to take applicant A over applicant B. Sure, we need to maintain high SAT scores, but beyond that there really isn't any requirement we're worried about. If I reject the 36 ACT 4.0 superstar, I lose nothing. If I accept him/her, I gain nothing. This is dangerous, because now we have a wealth of kids to pick from whose fate affects us in no way.

&#x200B;

*It's January 2nd, 2019 and I'm starting to read applications. I'm going through the applications for my region and read Applicant A. He's a USAMO qualifier, he tutors at-risk kids, he is captain of his state championship debate team. But he writes a really sort of average common app essay. Well my enthusiasm for him is only going to be so-so not because I choose not to be, but because I genuinely don't remember anything about him ten applications later. But, he still gets to make it through to the next round because his accomplishments are really strong and he scored a 35 / 3.95 UW.*

&#x200B;

*So his application comes up in committee. I, as his regional counselor, am responsible for pitching him. I stand up and tell my colleagues about this academic superstar, accomplished leader in his community, family oriented role model. I then explain his common app essay. I say all of this in sort of a matter-of-fact prose style. I try to be enthusiastic but faking it is hard. I get no reaction from the rest of my colleagues because 1) I personally am not enthused by the essay, and my lack of enthusiasm is very apparent and 2) his common app objectively sounds generic. Well, none of my colleagues are going to throw their weight for a kid who I myself am not crazy about. Also, nobody gets fired if we reject this superstar. We vote. He gets half yes's and half no's and he ends up in the deferred/waitlist/rejected pile. I don't personally care about this applicant, so I don't vote to appeal his case in the next round (which is something AOs do if they really love a kid that gets voted down).*

&#x200B;

*Then, I pull up the next applicant file. Applicant B, a girl with lower scores and worse ECs than Applicant A. I visibly get excited, as I had been anticipating this profile all day. This excitement translates immediately to my colleagues indirectly (as any room of people would) and the intrigue starts to build. They're wondering, what's got WilliamTheReader so excited? I tell this story about this sort of average, haven't done anything noteworthy applicant. I have an outline for what I'll say because I've been thinking about this particular case for a while. I describe the common app essay and how it made me personally feel, and even quote one of the more profound lines in her conclusion. Her supplements are well crafted, vibrant, and create a full picture of her. Everyone in the room can tell how passionate I am about this girl, and since I work with them everyday and there's some level of respect/office politics going on nobody thinks it's worth it to fight against me. We're all veterans, and the first rule you learn about committee is to pick your battles. We vote and she thus gets 0 no's (and therefore all yes's), and she gets the acceptance*.

&#x200B;

This sequence of events has happened multiple times every single day of committee, for every admissions office at every elite school in the country, for the past 20-30 years. As you can see, a bad pitch can ruin a good application, but a good pitch can really make the difference for a so-so application. **Average essays ruin top applications, strong essays boost average applications.**

&#x200B;

Hope this was helpful, and good luck everyone!

633,bah3y8,False,Major Advice,133,"Juniors/Underclassmen, Here's What I've Learned the Hard Way",ApplyingToCollege,"Brief Context: I am officially a member of the Carleton College Class of 2023, after sending in my fee last night!

I also got waitlisted by Williams College after becoming a proud Ivy Reject. Pretty good, right? Especially considering I was pretty much navigating this process blind, and made plenty of stupid mistakes.

Right, y'all. You're up next at bat, and while I've got all the faith in the world in you, here are my takeaways from this stupid process, for what they're worth:

\-For the love of all that is good and green in this world, do not use USNWR unless you're looking at rankings for your specific major (And even then, Shanghai Index is more reliable—though, it still has anomalies and mistakes) as a starting spot for your search. Just, don't. Look anywhere else.

\-You are allowed to hate ""prestigious"" schools, schools that are good for your major, or your parents'/beloved aunt's/favorite teacher's/coach's alma mater. Bearing that in mind, you are also allowed to really love schools you really didn't think you would.

\-Juniors—start those applications as soon as you finish your testing in May. Take a breather, but start drafting essays over the summer. Common App and Coalition App release their prompts fairly early on, and college prompts (Especially ""Why X College"") don't change much year to year, most of the time. Once your senior year starts, time available to work on applications is going to decrease exponentially. Make sure the lion's share of work is done before school really kicks in.

\-Freshmen/Sophomores, make sure you study for not only the SAT, but the PSAT—especially if you live in a state with a lower cutoff for NMSF. Colleges love to see National Merit stuff on your applications, and money can often get thrown your way.

\-Speaking of the SAT: whenever your scores come out, keep an eye on the news in case nonsense like what happened last year with the June SAT's curve, particularly if your scores are lower than what you expected (By this, I mean your raw scores don't line up with your final scores according to the conversion charts floating around). If history repeats itself, you'll want to know so you can figure out if you want to take the test again. DO NOT use this as an excuse on your applications.

\-Don't just have a safety or two that you really like—make sure they're FINANCIAL safeties as well. Look for a college that offers not only your major, but automatic merit that you KNOW you can get, like the University of Oklahoma, UT-Arlington, or Baylor University (Apparently, Texas is great for auto merit). This way, worst comes to worst, you know you'll have somewhere you can afford.

\-When figuring out what's a match for you, don't just look at last year's acceptance rate, but how much application numbers increased by year to year. A couple schools' acceptance rates plummet every year as they become popular, and you don't want to get burned by a school that would have been a match for you two years ago, but is now a reach.

\-If you want to apply to an Ivy or school with a comparable acceptance rate (Or even ""Stanford""), do so with the mindset that you're essentially burning that application fee money (Or waiver). Put all the time you want into them—heck, I used my Hicago essay prompts as a decompressor from the million other ""Why X"" essays I had to write—but don't send off your Duke or Pomona application with the expectation of anything other than a rejection. If you get in, fantastic, and congratulations!

\-The blame game never works. Take a day to mourn your losses in this process, and move on. Bitterness will get you nowhere. Hold your head high, and move on.

\-Keep your freaking grades up. Some B's (Or grades a letter lower relative to your average) are okay senior year, but don't screw around. Do the work you need to.

\-Lastly, I know everyone's said this a million times, but it can always be said again: *this process is a fucking crapshoot.* After sending your applications in and doing your interviews and sending in your mid-year reports, don't try and apply logic to your acceptances and rejections beyond a very limited point. You will have some results that just don't make sense. Roll with it.

This process isn't a reflection of your self-worth, at all. It's a question of how prepared and lucky you can be. I *was* lucky, and was accepted to an amazing school that I'll be attending in the fall, silently thanking that AO who saw something in my application the whole time.

And if you get rejected during this process?

Make those schools regret turning you down (In the good, non-destructive way).

&#x200B;

EDIT 1: Adding what u/sciecne says below: \[I am paraphrasing\]

\-Get very serious about your college essays once your senior year starts. Don't be afraid to ask multiple teachers to revise and look over your essays before submitting.

\-Practice for the SAT by taking full practice tests, and look at what concepts overall (Particularly math) you're missing in sections. Then, review with class materials to study basic concepts. This can really help your scores overall, instead of just doing ""hunt-and-peck"" studying with individual questions.

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: Adding what u/Xenofuscus says below: \[Paraphrased\]

\-This applies to all of high school, but especially junior second semester and senior year: do your best to take care of your health and yourself. Sleep and exercise regularly; it'll work wonders for your motivation and energy, especially on knocking out classwork and apps.

&#x200B;

\-Also, if things really get bad your senior year (And this should be done with great caution and scheduling): coming from me (OP), I would say take a mental health day, if you feel terrible. If you won't miss anything terrible, take a day off from school. Sleep in, catch up on homework, knock out a college supplement or two, and maybe watch a movie on Netflix. You should only do this once or twice a semester (If you feel the need for more, you should probably see your counselor or doctor), but mental health days  are good things in limited quantities.

&#x200B;

EDIT 3: I mention it in a response below, but make sure to fill out your FAFSA and/or CSS Profile or any school-specific sheet as early as possible as well. Don't be afraid to cajole your parents about this, as it saved me so much time and pain during the process. You'll have your finances squared away, and it'll make it easier to get your package (Or even a bigger one) or to appeal, if necessary.

&#x200B;

EDIT 4: Adding what u/jjss8 says below: \[Paraphrased\]

\-Regarding deadlines: be extremely careful of ""hidden"" deadlines, where scholarship deadlines are before actually application deadlines, such as schools like Georgia Tech and USC.

\-Send in your SAT/ACT/SAT II score *ASAP.* They take time to arrive at schools and be processed, so take advantage of the free score reports offered, if any.

\-Ask your teachers for rec letters early (Before September of your senior year, if possible); odds are, the teachers you ask are also being asked by multiple other students, and you don't want to be caught at the end of a list.

\-Check your portals once your application has been submitted for any missing documents or other components.

\-Don't stress out more than you have to! This process can be sort of fun, especially with some of the quirkier essays, as well as helping out your friends.

&#x200B;

EDIT 5: Wow, thank you whoever gave me my first gold, made my day! Right, so brief (And final; this post is getting *long)* additions from the comment sections. Underclassmen, there are a ton of seniors giving brilliant advice in the comment sections, really take a look through, there's a ton of useful stuff. Just a few quick highlights:

\-As mentioned by u/creddit_where_due, r/SAT and r/ACT are very valuable resources to check out, as well as Khan Academy, UWorld, and [1600.io](https://1600.io). They're all great resources, and they mention in their post another post in r/SAT where legal downloadable tests can be found.

\-As mentioned by u/Allupual, while making sure you have financial safeties, do make sure you can see yourself going there for four years (Or at least doing well there until you can successfully transfer), and that you like it.

\- u/hellaharper talks about it below, but: they got into a school usually not high on many people's lists, and were offered a ton of money, as well as great dorms and a hella cool exchange program/ Financial safeties can offer you more than an ""elite"" school might.

\-It's mentioned more than a few times overall, but don't forget to really dig into the difference between the ACT and SAT, and don't assume the SAT is the default. The ACT curve is less harsh, and there is a good chance you may do much better on it.

\-Last things, as talked about by u/Petrol_Oil below: breathe. Shoot for the moon if you can, but make sure you shooting for something you can realistically land on. This process is completely nonsensical, especially once you start looking at schools whose acceptance rate dip below \~40%.

\-Also, as they say: work hard on your apps, of course, but don't throw so much of yourself into them that you resurface some time later to find high school's passed you by. Some people are perfectly fine with that, but make sure you get a chance to make that choice.

634,edyphz,False,Best of A2C,63,How To Handle Imposter Syndrome,ApplyingToCollege,"You got in!  Congrats!  And everyone is clapping you on the back and beaming with pride for you, but somehow you feel...uneasy.  You can't shake the voice inside saying there's no way you deserved this.  Other people who had better stats got rejected, so this must have been a mistake.  Maybe they gave you way too much credit for your essays, or your URM status, or something.  Whatever the reason, you didn't earn this, and you're way over your head in a place you don't belong.  How will you cope with the guilt, cratered self-esteem, and nagging doubt?

1.  If you're feeling out of place or like you have major imposter syndrome, first recognize that this is a good thing.  It means you're doing so well for yourself that you feel out of place being so awesome and successful.  Success is what you make it, not how you feel compared to your peers.  So don't let it bother you.  Instead, you should feel good about having achieved so much and attained something great, regardless of whether or not you ""deserved"" it.

2.  This may shock you, but there's really only one reason you got in - they wanted you there.  And that alone means you deserve it.  Admission is holistic, so even if your GPA/SAT/ECs or whatever weren't the best in their admitted class, you had other things they loved.  Top schools receive tens of thousands of applicants and deny ~90% of them.  Many of those 90% were probably ""more academically qualified"" than you.  But they wanted you. 

3.  There are some 50 people fully engaged in the admissions process at most top schools.  These people are the world's foremost experts on their admissions, what they look for, how they decide who ""deserves"" it, etc.  **And they chose you.**  If JK Rowling tells you how to interpret a certain passage of Harry Potter, do you question her and instead trust your friend who just read it for the first time last week?  If Jennifer Doudna, Emmanuelle Charpentier, and Feng Zhang explain something about CRISPR to you, do you instead trust your peers who ""totally aced"" AP Biology?  If Katie Bouman tells you how to take a picture of a black hole, do you instead trust some people in your class who just got an SLR and telescope and are now experts on astronomical photography?  That would be asinine, worthless, lame, anti-vax, flat-earth BS.  Those people are not only the top experts on those subjects, they own them.  Every nuance and detail is meticulously shepherded and it's all entirely under their purview.  I'm struggling to even express how ridiculous it is for someone to second guess this or say they know better than the admissions office when it comes to their own admissions process.

4.  One of the lesser known facts about college admissions is that a few points on your GPA or SAT aren't really that big of a deal.  Colleges will often take an applicant with lower stats because of something else interesting or compelling in their application.  Maybe they have a unique and valuable skill.  Maybe they just seem like a really incredible person.  Maybe their achievements are indicative of a much higher ceiling.  Sure, a 1500 is going to be viewed very differently from a 1200, but it's not that different from a 1550 and many colleges even use SAT bands instead of actual scores in their rubrics because they don't want to use a microscope on it or overemphasize a few meaningless multiple choice questions.  

5.  Your job is not to justify getting in, it's to make the most of it now that you've earned this amazing opportunity.  You don't need to justify it to anyone **not even yourself**.  So stop trying.  Instead just focus on being the best you.  I'm going to say that again a little louder for the folks in back:

#You do not need to justify this to anyone, NOT EVEN YOURSELF.

6\.  Recognize that imposter syndrome never really goes away.  You will probably feel it at your first job out of college, after every promotion, after you start your own company, after you get elected, or whatever else you achieve.  Research indicates that even the very best people in the world at what they do still feel imposter syndrome, regardless of how accomplished they are.  So recognize that you're not alone.  Part of this comes from being the world's foremost expert on your own weaknesses, but it's not your incompetence or inadequacy or even your insecurity driving this - it's your humanity.  So don't feel like this sensation is bad or wrong or indicative of a problem.  It just means you're a real person just like everyone else.  Embrace it, lean into it, and let that nervous energy empower you.  Learn to live with being a better person than you think you have any right to be - it just means you're awesome.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/edyphz/how_to_handle_imposter_syndrome/,1203,"I used to watch college vids nonstop day and night through out high school.

635,fr9y0o,False,Serious,163,why I'm choosing to go to my safety state school over a T20,ApplyingToCollege,"This is not clickbait, I promise.

I don't post on here (or reddit) much, but I'm an avid lurker. And like most of you on this sub, I've grinded hard all of high school in hopes of getting into a good college. I have a ton of extracurriculars and awards, mostly to do with theater, on both a state and national level, leadership positions in multiple clubs, 8 APs, 1500+ SAT, a lot of work experience (3 different jobs over the past 2 years, with some overlap), hundreds of volunteer hours, etc.

So, after hearing back from everywhere, I ended up getting into one of my top schools. No one from my hs has gotten in there before, so I was shocked when I got into that T20. Yay! However, after weighing the pros and cons of going there, I've decided to commit with my safety school, and here's why:

1. Cost

I'm in that upper middle class income bracket where while my family is getting by comfortably and can help me pay for college, by no means can they  pay for all of it (nor would I want them to). My top school gave me no merit, and I won't be eligible for much financial aid (if any), so I'd have have to come up with 75k/year to pay for it. While my family would be able to help with some of it, I'd still have to front >$200k+ in loans. My safety school, on the other hand, gave me a full tuition scholarship, so all I have to pay is room & board, so **my entire college education there would cost less than 1 year at my top school.**

2. Fit

**You can't just pick what school you're going to based off of solely rankings.** If you do that, chances are you won't have a good time  (source: many people I know). The T20 has a great program for what I want to do, however, they're not nearly as flexible as the school I'm committed to. I wouldn't be able to do multiple study abroad semesters, and they might not even let me double major because they don't accept a lot of my AP credits. Also, I just don't vibe as much with the people going there. I'm in the honors college of the school I've committed to and the people there seem much more friendly and genuinely authentic than those I've talked to from the T20. This is just my personal experience though, but I know I want to feel like the people around me are real ones and I don't have to weed out as many superficial people that don't care about the people around them

3. Worth

In the field I'm studying, where you go to study for undergrad is not as important as what you do while you're there, and it's just not worth the extra debt. To get the most bang for my buck, I want to save as much money as possible for grad school in case I want to go down that route. **Just because you go to a good undergrad doesn't automatically set you up for complete success in life, it's all about what you make of it.**

In no way am I trying to knock T20s (because they're amazing schools for the most part and if you're going to one, congrats!!), I'm just saying that they're not the best or most feasible choice for everyone, and that it's good to keep an open mind when picking out where you want to spend your next few years and pick the school that's the best fit for you. I'm happy with the choice I've made and am hype to continue the grind the next 4 years! Also, this will probably be my last post on this sub, and I hope that everyone continues (or starts) to THRIVE! If anyone wants any more specific details about how I went about anything, feel free to PM me! Thanks to everyone on this sub for making this community a hilariously informative place.

637,ewuyu5,False,None,100,"Seniors: You need to watch this documentary, especially if you’re a woman",ApplyingToCollege,"TW: Sexual assault

I go to an all girls school and every year since 2016, we have shortened day where senior classes are suspended so we can watch The Hunting Ground and have a discussion on it. The Hunting Ground is basically about college’s and official’s responses on sexual assault on college campuses. It focuses on institutions such as UNC Chapel Hill, Harvard, Notre Dame, FSU, and more and, for the luck of a better term, their shrugging off of sexual assault claims. I believe every senior who’s about to start college in the fall watch this documentary and statistics saying between 1 in 4-5 undergraduate women being sexually assaulted on campuses, it’s especially vital for young women to watch it. It’ll break your heart, piss you off, and give you hope at the same time.

EDIT: According to RAINN, the national assault telephone hotline, [“Among undergraduate students, 23.1% of females and 5.4% of males experience rape or sexual assault through physical force, violence, or incapacitation.”](https://www.rainn.org/statistics/campus-sexual-violence). However, if RAINN isn’t enough for you, the National Sexual Violence Resource Center also cites [1 in 5](https://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/publications_nsvrc_factsheet_media-packet_statistics-about-sexual-violence_0.pdf) , citing the National Criminal Justice Reference Service


And so what if the stats are lower than one in four or one in five? Hell, we had a panel of speakers after the documentary and one who works for our states largest public university said its predicated at their particular college it’s one in three. Anyway, it’s still vital to raise awareness on sexual assault, especially the cover up by colleges across the country.


EDIT 2: Also, I’ve heard the argument that you can’t look at surveys you have to look at reported rapes. However, assuming the statistic reported in the documentary is correct, 88% of rapes that happen on college campuses are NOT reported. Finally, I’ll leave you with one of the most reliable and recent sources out there. The Association of American Universities released their 2019 sexual conduct and misconduct report in October. 181,000 college students were surveyed. [They found that 26.4% of women reported nonconsensual sexual contact by physical force or inability to consent. ](https://www.aau.edu/sites/default/files/AAU-Files/Key-Issues/Campus-Safety/Revised%20Aggregate%20report%20%20and%20appendices%201-7_(01-16-2020_FINAL).pdf)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ewuyu5/seniors_you_need_to_watch_this_documentary/,1198,[deleted] ,2020-01-31 21:06:05

640,alw2vj,False,None,134,let's make a company,ApplyingToCollege,"**This is going to be a long post. Before you apply or say anything, please read everything.**

Hi! I'm BakerHouse2021, the MIT student who runs [College Admissions Blog](http://collegeadmissions.blog/). From the Chance Me Calculator to Guess My Decision, I have developed a number of college-related apps.

I love blogging, but I've realized that the process is incredibly time-intensive. I want to give out as much advice as possible, but churning out content is a slow process, especially since I'm working alone.

**Having realized this, I'm reaching out to the A2C community to join me on my next venture.**

# The Idea

I'm developing a website filled with articles, advice, and tips for **AP classes**. There already exist a number of resources online to help students learn the specific content for each course. As such, I'm not looking to write resources on the content. Rather, I want to write content that acts as a ""synthesis"" layer, one level above the content. What do I mean by this?

There's a difference between learning the raw content for a class and processing it. It's one thing to memorize all the hard facts and formulas, and it's another to parse that information and break it up into key components.

I want a collection of articles such as: ""5 Key Things to Remember for the AP Chem Exam"" and ""Great Study Resources for AP Language."" The articles do not teach the content itself, but rather help hammer key points.

# The Issue

There are a ton of AP classes, and it's impossible for me to write 10+ articles for each course. Also, it's expensive to pay someone for each individual article.

# The Solution

I have years of experience in web development, blogging, and SEO. If done right, a site of this nature could receive millions of views over the course of a year, reaching thousands of students across the nation. The way I can make this idea a reality is if I gather a large group of writers, and if we can work together on churning out the content.

# Business Plan

Below you can find key points on how I plan to structure this project.

* 18 AP classes to cover
   * United States History
   * Biology
   * Calculus AB
   * Calculus BC
   * Chemistry
   * English Language and Composition
   * English Literature and Composition
   * Environmental Science
   * European History
   * United States Government and Politics
   * Macroeconomics
   * Microeconomics
   * Physics 1
   * Physics 2
   * Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism
   * Physics C: Mechanics
   * Psychology
   * Statistics
* 4 writers for each course (1 course manager, 3 authors)
   * The course manager vets the content and compiles a list of articles to write, and delegates it to his/her authors
* Total of 72 writers
* 1 CEO, 18 managers, 54 authors
* Revenue distribution
   * **CEO:** 10%
   * **Each manager:** 1.5% of monthly revenue
   * **Each author:** 1% of monthly revenue
   * **Savings:** 5%
   * **Bonuses:** 4%
* Recruiting for the first half of February
* Writing for the second half of February
   * Each author and manager writes **7, 1,000+ word articles** over the course of about a month
* Launch by mid-march (a bit ambitious, I know)
* I'll be developing the website, writing content, managing the social media, and advertising
   * I'll also build an ""Our Team"" page, including the headshots and names of managers and authors who want to be included
   * If we grow quickly, I'll look to get someone to help me with development and business strategy
* Bonuses will be distributed to each course team depending on performance
   * The job of the course manager is to work with his/her authors to determine what to write
   * The goal is to both help students, but to also *attract* students (for instance, the ""5 things you *need* to know"" template works well, as shown on PrepScholar); it's up to the course manager to devise a list of articles to write
   * Each course team will receive a bonus proportional to how well their content performs *relative* to their course's search volume on search engines
* By mid-March, the goal is to have over 500 pages of high-quality content on the website
* With over 500 pages, and assuming the content performs well on search engines, within three months the website could acquire 5,000,000 views, and with a page RPM of \~$3.00, that would be about $15,000 in revenue (and this would be through just one ad network; I also plan to use in-text advertising, which would yield approximately another couple thousand, but this is a very rough estimate)
   * The content will remain on the web permanently, and assuming growth month over month, and peaks in May, this project could provide a very steady passive income for *years to come*
* This is not a get-rich-quick scheme, but with correct execution and leadership, I see this being a fun project to work on with a large group of you

The Committee of Undergraduate Rejections has reviewed your rejection letter denying me from Penn’s Class of 2024. It is with great regret that I must inform you that I am unable to accept your rejection.


**Q**: Wait a minute, is this an appeal letter?

**A**: It is indeed. 


**Q**: Can’t this schmuck read our FAQ, which says no appeals?

**A**: In the light of unprecedented events (COVID-19), I figured I’d take a risk. 


**Q**: Is this for real, or a joke?

**A**: No offense taken if you have a good laugh and ignore it. Admissions officers work hard and deserve to have a chuckle once in a while. But extraordinary times call for extraordinarily gutsy decisions.


Since applying, here’s some stuff I’ve been up to:


I became a mod on A2C. I can absolutely destroy your reputation for all future applicants if I don't get in, so I'm expecting my acceptance package soon. [No, I didn't actually write this, there were actual updates but obviously no one wants to read that.]


I’d also like to reiterate my interest in Penn, one of the reasons I made the difficult decision to reject your rejection. [Boring why Penn stuff goes here].


Once again, I truly appreciate your interest in rejecting me, however, I wish you the best in accommodating me for an additional spot in Penn’s Class of 2024. If an accommodation is made, I would absolutely attend. In light of the difficult circumstances of COVID-19, I am willing to accept a spot in Penn’s Class of 2025, or a transfer option after a year at another university. 


Please note that this decision is not a reflection upon your institution, but rather one that reflects the difficulties of college applications. As I have been rejected from several institutions, I had to make the difficult choice to reject one of my rejections. I hope you understand.

644,gsxou5,False,Serious,204,Asian male in CS? Ivies are overrated,ApplyingToCollege,"Hellooooo people!

So if you're a rising or graduating Senior, this post will either be helpful or veryyy relatable, so please do read carefully

I'm going to argue that attending your state school or a top public university is better than attending an elite ivy league university if you wish to study computer science, and become a traditional software engineer or technical product manager at google, facebook, amazon, apple, microsoft, etc. you get the idea

First off, cost. I get that your parents come from an upper-middle class background and can pay for that, but don't underestimate just how much undergrad costs. For most students who cant get fin aid, it costs around 75k*4 = 300k for an undergrad education.

State schools on the other hand, especially if in-state, might cost around 30k, and can be done in 3 years with AP Credits. So, we're looking at 90k.

You've just saved 210k

Now, you're probably wondering ""but, hey! ivies have prestige and lead to a better life and have more opportunities""

You're right in some ways, but if you're a CS person, you seriously couldn't be more wrong.

Employers in the tech industry go to many of the top public universities, and heavily heavily recruit. I'm talking the public universities some ppl on this subreddit love, like UVA, michigan, berkeley, georgia tech, etc. but I'm ALSO (and this is the imp part) talking ab random universities you've never heard of, like North Carolina Agricultural and Technical Universities. You know those universities with 70% acceptance rates? or 50%? or 60%? Guess what! Google recruits there. (look at pitt, google has an office literally in pittsburgh, and they just pick up the top cs majors at pitt; it's not all cmu)

The point is, you don't need to go to some super prestigious school and pay a shitton of money and get depressed that you got rejected by a lot of other elite universities.

Save yourself the trouble for once in your life. Be HAPPY going to Berkeley or Michigan or your local state university. Don't cry over getting waitlisted at Cornell or Penn or rejected by Harvard and Columbia. If you're at the top of your public university, you can literally get any top CS job you would like.

In hindsight, I wish I recognized this. I personally was accepted by all 5 of the top 5 PUBLIC universities on US News, but at the same time, rejected by several ivies. For a while, I didn't appreciate getting into Berkeley, Michigan, Georgia Tech, etc. to study CS because I was so caught up with the elitism and prestige of Penn or Duke. Don't make the same mistake I did. Be happy and be proud. You got this.




P.S. Keep in mind, as much as some ppl want to deny it, every ivy league university does heavily consider race in building their class. As an asian male applying for cs, you're in the most overrepresented highly qualified demographic there is. Elite universities like duke or penn are looking to build a diverse class, so naturally they can't pick all the numerous highly qualified cs ppl. However, big state schools, like gtech and berkeley, don't care about your race. They look for raw, untamed MERIT: your POTENTIAL to succeed. As much as I hate the budget cuts and huge ass classes at these big public universities, that trait to be race-blind is exactly what I think will make them far stronger over the next decade.


P.P.S There are a *few* exceptions to this, but the colleges that fit into the exception are not ivies. Only three: MIT, Stanford, and CMU SCS. These three do have a some unique CS opportunities (especially if you're going for quant or fintech) that might not be readily available elsewhere. However, a great bulk of the CS graduates from even these institutions work the same software engineering jobs as their counterparts from strong public universities. Feel free to include Berkeley, Harvey Mudd, Caltech, UWaterloo, etc. as part of this bunch too. Berkeley and Caltech are self-explanatory, Harvey Mudd has an intensely rigorous engineering/CS curriculum, and Waterloo has a killer co-op program (like GT!).

656,gbnf6e,False,!!!,628,Congratulations to the Class of 2020!,ApplyingToCollege,"Congratulations, class of 2020!

It’s finally here — May 1st, National Decision Day. I don’t know about you guys, but it feels like it’s been forever since I last saw confetti popping up on my Common App after I submitted my applications. We all spent late nights studying, procrastinated on our college essays, anxiously opened our decision letters, and all the while, posted some great memes about this complicated process. But today is the culmination of all that, when we finally decide where and how we’ll be spending these next four years.

It’s unfortunate that our senior years have to end like this, and for all of the missed senior trips, proms, graduations, skip-days, and other traditions, I’m truly, truly sorry. However, I think we ought to appreciate the fact that we’ve had four whole years of amazing experiences with even more amazing people, and that we’ve created memories to share and reflect upon for a lifetime. While this is a bittersweet conclusion to our high school years, it’s certainly only the beginning for what’s to come.

Whether you were satisfied with your decisions this admissions season or not, I cannot stress this enough. Your college experience will be defined by how you take advantage of the opportunities and resources that lie before you, not by the college that you attend or by the rankings with which they are associated. With consistent effort, diligence, and ambition, all of our desires and aspirations are within our grasp.

I’m beyond proud to see the class of 2020’s tremendous achievements, and I’m so grateful for the supportive, collaborative environment that we’ve cultivated here in this community. While I encourage everyone to stay on A2C and lend a helping hand to the incoming senior class, I understand that this will also be a final goodbye to many of you. We’re all in this together!

My first name, Jacob, was ranked the most frequently-given baby name of 2001 (ssa.gov). Since I know that elite colleges look at applications ""holistically"" and want a diverse class, will having an extremely common first name like 'Michael' or 'Matthew' drastically lower my chances of being accepted? There was a person at my school two years ago (who I think was originally called James)... he switched his name right before application season to 'Tichawonka' and got into Stanford, Princeton, Harvard, Tsinghua, etc. Coincidence? I doubt it; he flunked nearly all his classes and had virtually no ECs.

My mother and the 11 out of 12 of my private college consultants believe that I should replicate this in compensation for donating only one building to Harvard this year. I really don't want this to happen (I prefer my current name to some of the alternatives my parents have suggested). To make matters worse, we've already hired a big-name lawyer who ""can get it done within a week"". I'm very skeptical... is it really a good idea to legally change your first name in order to boost your chances at these top institutions?

I'm doing an awesome internship right now, and my classmates are also doing great. They work at places like Microsoft, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, NASA, Space-X, ExxonMobil, and other top companies. 

So don't fret so much about getting into a top tier university, you'd be surprised at how little your school matters in the long run. It's all about what you make of it.

663,f61kqf,False,None,80,For all y’all that need to improve your social skills before college,ApplyingToCollege,"I’m seeing a lot of posts about losing out on high school experiences and stuff so here’s some pointers on how to get conversations going and make some friends in college.

1. Ask about their day/weekend. People usually can go on and on about their weekends. 

2. Talk about politics...maybe. There’s always something on the news about politics so you can just talk about that but don’t get too defensive and whatnot otherwise you’ll make enemies instead of friends.

3. Sports. Basketball and football are hot topics. I can talk on and on about basketball plus there are games like everyday so there’s always something to talk about.

4. Music. I found a lot of my friends through music. Just ask them what their favorite music is and see if you can can listen to songs together /recommend any songs.

5. Summer plans. Ik summer’s long off but people have already been planning it (trips, internships, jobs, etc)

6. Driving. A lot of people our age are driving now so just talk about scary experiences or like how to get a license.

7. Ask about a homework assignment. Even though you may know how to do it, sometimes just asking for the sake of conversation can help develop friendships.

8. This kinda relates to 2 but just talk about what’s on the news. Like the coronavirus, for example.

9. Just complain. About driving, about parents, about siblings, about a teacher, about homework, about a test, etc. People usually have A LOT to say if they’re complaining about something.

These are some basic tips! Please drop any other pointer in the comments!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/f61kqf/for_all_yall_that_need_to_improve_your_social/,1171,"Imo complaining is a double edged sword.

664,dtml35,False,None,54,"On all the ""philosophical"" admissions negativity...",ApplyingToCollege,"The admissions process isn't fun. That's just a fact. But lately I've been seeing all these posts on A2C criticizing the process in a philosophical/""deep"" way. I just wanted to address the trend. To the people who have been writing these: you're great writers, and I'm sure you'll go far in college and beyond. This isn't supposed to be a call-out post for you. I'm just trying to make the process a little better for everyone.
The admissions process might not be everyone's favorite thing (it sure isn't mine). Everyone has one part they hate more than the rest. For me, it's essays. I just can't seem to write them in the right way. For other people, it might be standardized testing, or ECs, or just schoolwork in general.

But here's the thing: **If you want to go to college, you have to apply.** There's no school that's going to magically show up at your door and offer you admission. If you want to go to college, you're in the application process right now. (If you haven't started your apps yet, close this window and open the common app.) If you're reading this, you probably want to go to college. So you have to apply. Yay! What does that mean? Cue the dramatic A2C posts...

*I've wasted the past 4 years working on homework and schoolwork in hard classes!*  
*I've spent time doing things I don't even care about just to look like a ""good student""*  
*I had to take this super pointless test a bunch of times and waste my time and money!*  
*And now colleges want me to reduce myself into 600 words!!!*

I used to say stuff like that too, until I realized three key things: 

1. If you hate the process, you're doing it wrong.  
You don't have to love the College Board, or enjoy taking the SAT. But if you hate your extracurriculars, you probably picked the wrong ones. If you hate spending time in class, now you know what subjects you shouldn't major in. If you absolutely hate writing your essay, change the topic! You're not trapped in the things you do. You haven't ""wasted your time"". You've gotten one step closer to college, and learned things you'll need to know in the future - even if it's just what you don't want to study. So when you go off to college, you'll be better prepared for it. And who knows, maybe you even had some fun along the way. You know, just a little. :)

2. It's really not that deep.  
Colleges aren't reducing you to 600 words or a 4 digit number, as much as it might feel like it. The essay isn't asking you to condense yourself into 600 words. Honestly, you're already in the application. Your ECs, transcript, recommendations, accomplishments, and maybe interview all tell enough of a story. The essay isn't forcing you to fit yourself in a text box. It's giving you the opportunity to put your own voice in the application, and just talk to the admissions officers.  
In the same way, the numbers aren't everything either. Colleges look at your SAT and GPA (but not really GPA, more the transcript) to make sure you're academically prepared. But for most schools, the stats don't make the decision. They're just one way you can show you're ready and you've accomplished a lot. That can also come through in your ECs and recommendations. Don't stress about the numbers. You're so much more, and colleges know it.

3. (the most important one) Complaining doesn't get anything done.  
I'm not saying you can't complain. Complaining is fine, and honestly it's healthy. But don't get yourself so worked up about the process as being ""horrible"" and ""unfair"" that you lose all motivation to work on your apps. I've been there. My friends used to go on and on about how awful the process was, and it made me lose some of my motivation to get them done. If you're positive about the process, you'll have so much more motivation, and writing those apps becomes so much easier. Just try it out for a couple days. You'll see the difference.

So just remember: The process isn't all that bad. It is what it is, and if you want to get to college, you have to make the most of it. Even though it's perfectly fine to complain, don't worry too much about how ""awful"" it is - just focus on how great your applications are going to be! :)

665,ejg6g4,False,None,322,Serious question- do kids at your school cheat?,ApplyingToCollege,"I was curious because I recently found out a former friend of mine got into a T5, and they're the type of person who cheats to get a 100% in a class instead of a 96% (Even though they are both high As). They're very smart, albeit not very kind, they just happen to cheat a lot to keep a 4.0. They're just the type of person to sneak in the ACT math formulas, even though they are good at math, if that makes sense. 

I honestly didn't even realize how big of a thing cheating was until AP World junior year, when people would whisper during the test for answers and get mad if you didn't reply. Students would also brag about how good they are at cheating. 

Anyways, how much do people cheat at your guys' school? And how much do you think it affects their GPA?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ejg6g4/serious_question_do_kids_at_your_school_cheat/,1165,"Hot take right here: I personally don't cheat often, but its wrong to dislike cheaters unless they are cheating at the expense of other people.

The education system is broken, we all know that, but just because some people have figured out a way to work smarter, not harder, in subjects that might not particularly interest them doesn't mean that they care less about school. There are several ways to pass tests, and depending on what people are okay with, different options are open to them. Though it might seem like they are lazy freeloaders who thrive off of ready-made answers, it may not be the case. 

School has grades, it's quantitative. Sure you could argue ""oh no it's qualitative because you have the ABCD bs"" but it doesn't change the fact that it's a 4.0 at the end of the day. With any quantitative system, you can game it. You can manipulate the circumstances to reach the desired number. 

Two students with the same number might have taken different paths to get there. One might have worked hard and studied up to memorization, and Two might have just looked up the answers and found a way to sneak it into class online, but that doesn't change the fact that both have the same grade.

What I'm tryna say is that the second student isn't your enemy, rather it's the education system. So let's all shut up, work with our peers so we can get into college and fix this bullshit. ",2020-01-03 14:35:32

671,gwl8f4,False,Serious,66,The school I applied to 2 months late became the school I’m now committed to,ApplyingToCollege,"Just something I was thinking about that I wanted to share in case anyone else found it interesting or whatever. It might look long but I rlly don’t think it’s a terrible read 🥺 read if u would like, The title is basically the TL;DR

I live in California so it was expected of me to apply to 4 UCs and 4 CSUs. I did that and also applied to Stanford, USC, and Cornell (uw gpa 3.2, w gpa 3.7, sat score 1210) I had no chance of getting into most of these schools. My only match schools were the CSUs I applied to and one of the UCs.

ANYWAYS, fast forward to college decision season and I was rejected from all of these schools (except 3 CSUs). I made a dummy mistake and literally chose the CSUs at random because I thought for sure I’d get into just one UC and everything would be chill. But I was bombarded with rejection after rejection from all these schools and I just kept thinking “it’s okay there are still more decisions to come out!” And then the final rejection letter came. It was from UCLA and I cried for like 2 hours straight over it and I had to leave the group chat for a few days because my friend got in to UCLA and I was so sad about everything. I thought my essays really gave me a chance and it sucked that not one school I wanted wanted me back.

I started looking into community college, and 2 community colleges near me are feeders into UCLA for transfer students. But then I came to reddit and saw a giant list of schools that are still accepting applications off rolling admissions. I had no clue schools were still accepting so I looked through and googled them and applied to some more. Off rolling admissions I applied to DePaul, Pitt, and Penn State. I was accepted to all of these schools but had to decline Penn state and Pitt because of financial aid.

I decided I wanted to apply to more schools in case DePaul didn’t work out, so I used the college search feature on college board’s website and found Syracuse University in NY. It was the last school I applied to. I actually applied to this school 2 months after their deadline, they weren’t accepting off rolling admissions. I applied to this school and like a month and a half later I got an acceptance letter into the exact program I applied to. DePaul never ended up giving me my financial aid package, and I was bummed because it was my first choice and I had grown a little bit attached to it, but Syracuse is an amazing school and they offered me amazing financial aid. I was offered about $60k in grants and $10k in loans, but I can always apply for scholarships or save up money from work study, summer jobs, or whatever so that I don’t have to take out loans after this year. And I don’t have to make any payments at all!! Which is so amazing because my family can’t afford to make any payments for college right now. Their housing and tuition deposits combined totaled $950 and they waived both of them for me, so I was able to commit for free! It was a huge weight off my shoulders because I couldn’t cough up $950.

Ik I could’ve made this a lot shorter, but I just wanted to add some extra details that maybe someone here could relate to. It’s funny that the last school I applied to (2 months late) wasn’t even accepting rolling admissions but it became the School I’m committed to. I just thought it was a little interesting and also I wanted to use this as an opportunity to tell people not to give up right away, unless you’re fine with how things turned out. But if you’re unhappy with what schools you were accepted to, just try to apply to some more. Maybe even apply to these schools that have rolling admissions EARLY, so that you have backups before the big schools’ decisions come out. Don’t just give up. If you’re fine with or happy to go to a smaller state school or community college, then of course do it! But if you’re a person that just really wants a shot at a larger 4 year, or a school maybe a little further from home, there will be schools accepting applications, and some of them are amazing schools with great financial aid! You just gotta put yourself out there and know not to give up because it really isn’t over until you say it’s over.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gwl8f4/the_school_i_applied_to_2_months_late_became_the/,1162,"Hey!

Your credit card won’t work. The website will crash.  Your pet will have a crisis. Try to give yourself a day, but at the very least give yourself five hours cushion time. 

* Get up from your computer and walk around every hour or so. Go outside.  Let your brain reset occasionally.  

* Be sure to preview your essays after loading them into the app, and see that the spacing is the way you want it. Chrome will automatically bold your essays. You can easily unbold.

* Read your essays OUT LOUD — to someone else if possible. You will notice missing words and funny verb tenses.  Listen and feel for bumps. That’s where you need to edit. Make sure it sounds like you. Couple of hints I’ve heard or read around here:
1. Read your essay to your phone recorder and then listen back for the bumps. 
2. Print up the preview copies and read it to look for bumps and typos. 

* If it sounds like you've swallowed a thesaurus 🦖, go back and use words you know and understand.  It's really disconcerting as a reader to feel that bump with a word that just isn't right. Use words you know.  And understand.  

 * Stop and breathe.  You might start feeling overwhelmed; just take 5 minutes and close your eyes and breathe.  You will be amazed at how much better you feel. 

* In your essays, your tone should be casual and conversational. Like you’re talking to an older cousin you respect. It’s ok to use contractions. Eliminate adverbs, especially all verys and reallys.  

* Be sure to preview your essays after loading them into the app, and see that the spacing is the way you want it. 

* After submitting, look through and make sure all the parts went through.  Especially check to make sure that your supplements were submitted. You often need to go back and send them after paying and sending the common app. 

* For deadlines of Nov 1, you have until midnight on Nov 1 — do not wait until then to submit — see my above notes about zombie apocalypses and websites crashing. 

* For many colleges it’s ok for your supplementary materials like LORs, transcript, and test scores to arrive after the app. Check the colleges’ websites to determine their deadlines. 

* If you haven’t sent your test scores yet to schools that require official scores, do that today. 

* Recognize that this learning process is what college admissions is really all about. Reflect on how much you are learning about yourself right now as you are going through this.  No matter where you go to college, you will be more in tune with who you are for having gone through this journey of self-exploration.  Be proud of it. 

* This is the part you can control. Show them the best you on your very best day. 

* Once you’ve let those beautiful baby bird early apps go from your nest, let them fly.  Be sure to check up on your portals in the next few days and see what you need to finish, but beyond that move on to your other apps. 

Ok!  That's a long enough procrastination break -- now giddy up; get back to work!  👏👏👏

You got this! 

Remember to breathe,

💙 admissionsmom

686,gmsh86,False,Best of A2C,115,Juniors: Bored At Home? Here’s What You Can Do,ApplyingToCollege,"So, maybe quarantine’s getting you down. Maybe you’re like me, and haven’t done homework in weeks (would not recommend, even for a senior). In any case, you’re definitely on A2C and probably looking for something to do. Here are some ideas. 


&nbsp;


**Start planning for your letters of recommendation.**

Figure out who you’re going to ask, and start preparing all the materials. I have a whole post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gm1jbc/letters_of_recommendation_101/) that dives into much more detail on what you should be working on. 


&nbsp;


**Start narrowing down your college list.**

This is pretty important. I thought I had picked out a good list, and then changed my mind about applying to a lot of colleges, and **then** I thought I had figured it out by the time I had submitted my apps. After submitting, I realized I didn’t want to go to some of the schools I applied to, whether it was fit, financial aid, or strength in my major.


Here are some quick tips on choosing what colleges to apply to:

* If you need financial aid, apply to colleges with generous financial aid. Most T20s and top LACs offer the most generous financial aid. Run each college’s NPC (Net Price Calculator) to determine how much you would get. These are generally extremely accurate unless you have a weird source of income or other extenuating circumstances.

* Side note: also **consider colleges with generous merit scholarships**. u/ScholarGrade has a very thorough list [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/azu8o2/change_your_trajectory_full_ride_scholarship/). Keep in mind that these are extremely competitive. You need higher stats than even those who get into T20s. (Usually, those who get these are those who get into HYPSM etc., the merit sways them and gets them to attend these schools instead). 

* **Consider fit over shotgunning.** Some colleges have very different cultures than others. For example, Duke, Vandy, and Dartmouth are all T20s that are very fratty, and on the other end of the spectrum, you have schools like MIT, UChicago, and Caltech which are more known for their course rigor and difficulty (others would call it stress culture). 

* **Find schools that are strong in your department of interest.** Some schools are known for certain things, others are excellent for everything (cough cough Stanford). For example, Georgetown SFS is hands-down the best program for international relations, UPenn Wharton is the best for business, etc. Georgia Tech is great for engineering, Purdue & UIUC are great for CS. 

* Yes, put that college that is “out of reach” on your list. Even if you don’t get in, you aren’t left wondering what could’ve happened.


&nbsp;


**Start drafting essays.**

I know it’s early, but the work you put in now means that work that you won’t be suffering over essay writing during Christmas or New Year’s. Keep in mind that Common App wipes/resets every August, so you shouldn’t start filling in anything in Common App yet. Most schools’ supplements stay the same or change very slightly each year, so I wouldn’t worry about your effort going to waste. Even if they do change the essays, you can probably use the already written essay for another school, and you’ve gained experience writing essays. 

Speaking from personal experience, I found that it took much longer than anticipated to brainstorm essay topics, write them, and then edit them until I was satisfied. And despite the fact that my essays were not great in the summer, it gave me a good foundation to approach more supps in the fall as well as a crude draft of some supplements to refine.


&nbsp;


**Start studying for standardized testing.**

I’d say drop the SAT IIs (unless your schools require them), most schools don’t care much about them and many other schools are dropping the requirement/the option to even submit SAT IIs (hello MIT & Caltech, trying to lower your acceptance rate?). r/SAT & r/ACT are great places to find advice or other free resources. My guess is that less emphasis will be placed on test scores, but it’s still important: colleges still have to pad their median SAT & ACT scores.


&nbsp;


**Start working on a personal project.**

This isn’t as daunting as it sounds. Find something you’re legitimately interested in, and pursue it, even if it’s for an hour a day. I imagine you guys have a lot of free time. Personally, I’ve been improving my cooking & baking (free time = lots of breadmaking), working out a lot, exploring my town through biking, and a little bit of Python coding. “Sure,” you say, “but that doesn’t even sound like an EC to me.” Wrong: I literally put cooking as one of my ECs (I spent a decent amount of time on it last year), and was able to talk about it in a meaningful way. Plus, it’s an extremely valuable life skill. 

Working out may not be an EC in of itself, but you can certainly make it into one. I founded a fitness club at my school to coach other kids, and talked about that as an EC. “Well, I can’t do that now.” Obviously not, but I actually saw a reddit post on A2C asking if anyone wanted to get in shape and keep each other accountable. I asked OP if they wanted to make a groupme, and now we’re at 80+ members and counting. I’ve also helped set up a google classroom to keep group members accountable and to help coach others. That, combined with working out, can definitely be counted as an EC. (If any of y'all want the link, please chat/PM me). 


&nbsp;


**Or, look for other interesting things to pursue.**

It doesn’t have to be a project, but there are certainly things you can be doing. One of my friends was doing shopping with InstaCart (relatively safe, the only risk is when you go shopping, the delivery is contactless) and making $20/hr. A job is always an EC. Speaking from personal experience, part-time or entry level jobs are also looking for workers now. 

Or maybe there’s something else you’re interested in. Maybe that’s reading (if that’s fanfiction, I don’t judge and AOs will never know if you just list reading as an coronavirus activity), or writing, or drawing, or painting, or woodworking, or learning a language, or anything else you can think of. The best thing to be doing is learning **something** that you’re interested in. COVID-19 has given us a gift in the form of a shitton of free time to take a breath and slow down.


&nbsp;


**TL;DR**: make a college list, get LORs, start your essays, pursue your interests.

You might’ve even been waiting for this day -- not since Dec 31 or last fall sometime when you hit submit on your apps, but for years. And as I think most of you recognize, some (most) of you are going to be extremely disappointed today, and others will be over the moon excited. So, I want to tell you how proud I am of each and every one of you. In the last year or so that I've been nagging at you to remember to breathe, keep life in perspective, and open your minds about essays, college lists, and your ECs, I've seen such growth. I've seen you mature from kids who seemingly only care about prestige, where you get in, and writing obnoxious braggy essays, to young adults who are giving each other truly awesome advice and pieces of wisdom. It has been an amazing process to watch. Your support for each other is real. You all are incredible kids. Please remember that today. And tomorrow. And next week. And next year. 

So, do me a favor. Let’s take the focus off your college decisions for just a few minutes. I want each one of you to write to me right now, and for the next few days,  or the next week or hell, forever, and tell me three things in your life you’re  grateful for.  You can respond here or pm me if you'd rather. You come from around the world with so many different circumstances, and I know many of you have struggled with parts of your lives. I've heard your stories, read your essays, and even cried for some of you, but today I want to focus on the good stuff. So tell me three things you are thankful for. Big or small. 

(Please feel free to respond even if you're not a senior.  We often have younger kids and college kids and older join us!)

I'll go first. Two years ago, I wrote about being grateful for this subreddit, my crazy amazing kids and my wonderful mom who supported me in life and decisions even when she disagreed. Last year, I wrote about my love of travel, and how thankful I was for books and movies. 
 
Today I’m grateful for:

1. The hard times. When my mom
died right around the same time of empty nesting, I lost my sense of identity. I’d been a daughter my whole life and most recently her caretaker as she was very ill for her last three years. And I’d been a mom for 25 years and suddenly, that seemed over.  I wasn’t sure what to do with myself because my roles that I so strongly identified with were gone. I had to really dig in and find myself and what I wanted. It was hard. But I’d never change those hard, sad days (and there were many). It was almost as if I was emerging from a chrysalis. 

2. Yoga.  In the last two years, I have discovered the benefits of the connection of my body and my mind. I’d always been more of a life of the mind person, but now I really know the connection and how much I have to pay attention.  In fact, I am training and studying to be a yoga teacher now. 

3. The now. Right now. This moment. I’ve learned to appreciate and try to be aware of the moment I’m in. I’d always been a planner. Thinking of the future and in doing so missed out on so much of my life, so now I work very hard to be present. And I’m so thankful for the moments when I can look up and see how green the trees are or how soft my dog’s fur is or how amazing your writing is. 

Now it's your turn. I can't wait to hear from you.  

As you’re thinking about what you’re  grateful for today, remember it can be big or small. An added benefit is that research shows that people who take the time to note their gratitude daily are in general Happier and more content.  Regardless, remember that no matter the outcome today— whether in your favor or not, you’re more than your college acceptances. They don’t define you.  You are a badass with or without any specific school or schools.  

Prepare yourself with some emotional planning during the day.  While it’s ok to hold on to hope for the best, be prepared for the worst. Hold on to your heart. 

Now. Let me know what you’re thankful for in your life!  And breathe. 💙😊",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/b6h3rf/dear_beautiful_seniors_please_hold_on_to_your/,1137,"i’m a junior but it can’t hurt!

1. my mother. my father was overseas from kindergarten to 6th grade, so my mom had to take charge of the household when me and my brother were growing up. i had to become a mini-adult in a way, because my mom worked all day and i needed to make sure my brother got the love he deserved. she also worked at a book fair company so i developed a love of reading and writing from there and it just took off. she’s the reason why i am where i am.

2. my heritage. i’m native american, but was adopted by a white family in the suburbs when i was born. i’m so thankful that throughout everything, my parents made sure i knew of my heritage and was at least somewhat involved until i could get enrolled in my tribe (it’s happening soon!!!!!). really, it’s what got me into activism, which has shaped my life from the NODAPL movement to MFOL.

3. schrodinger’s cat. it may seem frivolous and stupid to some, but this quantum mechanics thought experiment is what made me realize STEM is the path i want to follow. one day, in 6th grade, i watched a SciShow video on it because i was scrolling through youtube and i was bored. i didn’t understand half of the theories and terms he mentioned, but i understood the gist of it. i explained it to my mom (who didn’t get it) and explaining this paradox made me feel so alive and so smart. it was then that i understood that studying science/physics will make me feel that way all of the time. smart and grateful.

My senior year and my gap year up until this point were filled with rejections from pretty much everywhere I applied to that could give me finaid. I got into GaTech with zero aid, and that was even more painful. 

So I made quite a dark post here (which I’ve since deleted) about all the places I got rejected from and my feelings towards this whole process. In the comments, some super great person suggested I apply to Michigan State. With nothing to lose, I did so immediately.

Shortly after, I got in with $32,000 in aid, but the remainder was still too expensive for my dad. I emailed them and detailed my situation, and they gave me $10,000 extra! 

So THANK YOU to whoever that was! You saved my mental health and possibly my life.

710,7hs45h,False,None,110,Don't be like me,ApplyingToCollege,"I know early decision and early action decisions are coming out soon, and as a current college freshman who frequented this sub last year, I wanted to give some advice on how to handle the decisions and enjoy the coming years.

When I was in high school, I was a good student like most of you. I was consistently ranked top 10 in a class of 600 at a competitive high school in a competitive area. I scored 240 on the PSAT and 2400 on the SAT when I was in 10th grade, and decided to take the ACT later just to prove a point to a friend that I could ace all three. I participated in a bunch of math contests - I won some local awards and went to ARML and qualified for AIME for those who are familiar with the math competition circuit. I did environmental research with local town officials during three major research projects over the course of my high school career. I entered in the big science contests (Siemens, Intel, etc.), but didn't win anything beyond the local level. I did some other clubs (Science Olympiad, some honor societies), did some volunteer service, did a summer math program, and had a sport outside of school that I was good but not great at. 

Over the summer entering my senior year, I constantly checked this sub for advice on my essays, how to present myself on my applications, etc. I made a list of 13 colleges to apply to, ranging from guaranteed full scholarship safeties to some of the best colleges in the world. I kept reading here how top colleges were never a guarantee for anyone, but I was confident I could get in minus maybe one or two. I submitted all of my applications regular decision. I heard back from my 2 safeties (both outside of top 50 on US news) first. But then when the other decisions started coming in, the results weren't quite what I expected. In total, I was accepted at my two safeties, 3 that were in the 30 - 50 range on US News, and one top 20. I was denied from 4 (all top 10) and waitlisted at 3, including one state school ranked outside of the top 25. I was shocked, angry, upset, everything. I was expecting to maybe not get into the top ivies, but to be waitlisted at multiple colleges outside the top 15 was a shock.

For the coming months, I was bitter and resentful toward everyone. My best friend was accepted at MIT, his top choice, and instead of being happy for him, I was resentful that I had better stats but didn't get into schools of similar caliber. I eventually committed to a top 20 school, but felt that I was above it, that I deserved and was entitled to better. Everyone congratulated me, and I outwardly thanked them, but I was still bitter. I would spend my free time on the College Confidential threads, getting mad at the people who got into Harvard or Princeton or wherever with ""only"" 34's on the ACT or 3.8 GPAs, thinking that they didn't deserve it. 

When I got to college in August, I pretty much isolated myself from everyone else. Every time I would pass by a black kid, or hispanic kid, or athlete, my mind would immediately switch to a sense of anger, mad that they supposedly only got in because of the advantages in the admissions process. I didn't bother to go to any of my classes because I figured I'm so much smarter than everyone here that I could beat the curve without even trying. I pretty much just stayed by myself in my dorm room all day wishing I was somewhere else.

It wasn't until the first midterm grades started coming in that I realized I was being ridiculous. I was under-performing on tests and hadn't been handing in any work. I realized that I needed to change and finally, 10 weeks into the semester, I went to the medical center and got therapy for my issues. I finally started to realize that I was lucky to be at a prestigious school (even if it's not the most prestigious), and started to put more effort into classes and developing relationships with other students. Now, during finals week, I've been going to class and hanging out with people in my dorm and doing normal college stuff. But I can't help feeling like I missed out on almost an entire semester of positive experiences (and GPA points) just because I was stubborn and entitled.


So please try not to be like me. If you don't get into your dream school, or even any of your top choice colleges, it's not an indictment on you as a person or even as a student. Remember the top colleges get many more applications than they have space for. All the time you hear of kids getting into Harvard and not Brown or MIT and not Carnegie Mellon. With the exception of maybe a few handfuls of truly brilliant and incredibly accomplished students, no one is going to get in everywhere. But as long as you continue to work hard, you'll end up somewhere good. Every college has smart and talented students. Maybe some more than others, but no matter where you go, if you work hard and rise to the top, you'll have the same opportunities as everyone else, whether it be for graduate school or jobs or anything else (except for maybe at Goldman Sachs but they're a bunch of pretentious babies anyway). Assuming you applied to a range of colleges where you'll be happy attending, you'll be fine wherever you go. Don't let a few rejections ruin the experience for you.

I was supposed to interview with a Penn alumnus who worked in the white house, but she wouldn’t say who. She offered to send me a car the next afternoon to bring me to the white house.

712,bws042,False,None,142,Are we sheep?,ApplyingToCollege,"I go to a large, semi-competitive suburban school in the Bay Area, and as application season nears (I'm a rising junior), I'm beginning to realize that I can't stand the people I hang out with. Yes, I'm Asian-American, and most of my friends are Asian-American as well. Yes, I know we place so much emphasis on learning and education and hard work because back home, that was the only chance we had at climbing the opportunity ladder, the only way to ensure stability in life.

And yet, I hate it all. How cheating is rampant at our school, how we've had four major scandals regarding finals being leaked (or stolen) the day before finals day. How we whisper in hushed voices in the back of classrooms, the occasional furtive glance at a senior, about Emma--*she got into Harvard;* about Bryan, who *didn't deserve to get into MIT;* about William, *how is he even valedictorian? He only got into Berkeley.* How we can never be happy for other people's achievements. It's always arched eyebrows, did your parents get you it you're not even good at law/medicine/coding you're not even going into law/medicine/coding that's totally useless doesn't mean anything when it comes to college admissions but yo mate, can you hit me up?

Earlier last week, my friend walked up to me and asked, ""So, are you smarter, or is John?"" and I didn't know how to respond. I mean, there were so many things I could have said: you can't distill intelligence into smart, less smart, not smart; we're more than the sum of our grades and extracurriculars; how the hell do you measure that? But I didn't say any of it, just shrugged.

It's not uncommon to hear students disparaging ""smart"" seniors who hadn't gotten into ""top"" schools. When did we start to measure someone's worth in the number of T10s they were accepted to? But, hearing the comment about Bryan, I guess it's not just those who don't get into good colleges; even HYPMS-bound students aren't immune. It's just--I don't know. I can't stand it, all the toxicity and competition surrounding college admissions. When did we decide that the ultimate factor in how kind/interesting/influential/smart you are is what college you attend?

We're so shallow. Superficial. Packaging ourselves in pretty, sparkly Christmas wrapping, embellished with a perfectly-tied ribbon and a note card that plays at altruism. Part of the problem is college counselors, all the rage right now because *look!* I'm both *rich* and *Ivy-bound*. Here's a list of everything you need to do to demonstrate your interest in political science, to develop a spike: join MUN, Debate, Youth & Government, Mock Trial, TPUSA. Found a Democrats/Republicans club, MUN club at the middle schools, Debate club at the middle schools. Do the UN summer program, the Senate Page Program, YYGS PLE, the other pre-collegiate programs that offer a politics course. Take a mission trip to Africa and bring the people clean water. Organize a book-giving service to impoverished children in Laos. Check, check, check. Nothing more than a checklist, that, when completed, will realize all of your Ivy League dreams. For a second, the admissions officers are fooled.

So we lose the spark that drives us to change the world for the better, or maybe we never really had it. And even if we're truly passionate about a subject, and we do get into T10s, what happens after? Sell-out culture. Starry-eyed freshmen wanting to be human rights lawyers like Amal Clooney, now going on to law school and working at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen, and Katz. Others can't resist the allure of six figures at Goldman Sachs.

I don't know where I'm going with this post, only that I think the high school/college/higher education system is very much flawed. We aren't better people. We're just good sheep.

715,frglqb,False,Quality Meme,168,Please help settle a bet,ApplyingToCollege,"At some point in December, either out of a desire to distract myself from final exams or merely kill time, I set out with a mission: create the most well-crafted, yet absolutely horrendous, Stanford application essays as I possibly could. In retrospect, my exact reasoning for this decision was hazy, but I did it anyway. What astonished me more though than the fact that I had actually written these essays, however, was that many people, people who I rightfully trust, believed that I had made a mistake in not actually applying with the following essays (in text, and also in the Google Doc). Somehow, they believed, like The Producers, this would be a case of ""so bad it's good"". Some disclaimers:

\-I did not choose to apply to Stanford, both because there would be far better ways for me to waste money and because I wanted to go to a large public school.

\-Academically and in terms of other attributes, I would have been generally qualified; the following essays would most likely be the topic of differentiation, not necessarily anything else. That is irrelevant in this case, however.

\-I hold no personal grudge toward Stanford for any reason, even if I did not/do not believe it was/is the right fit for me.

The question: Are the following essays so terrible/disdainful/weird/whatever else that they would automatically put me out of contention of being accepted to Stanford? Not that they would get me accepted, but I am personally of the belief that these would be immediately disqualifying, while most have argued the exact opposite. 

Mods, I do apologize if this is too tangential for this subreddit.

The essays:

##### Briefly elaborate on one of your extracurricular activities or work experiences. (150 words)

In the middle of my senior year, I was able to exploit an opportunity given generously by my former Chinese teacher to tutor her academically-challenged son in AP Physics. He was “slow,” according to his mother; I had no hope for him. Still, I knew it was my duty to help the less fortunate, those who were not blessed with my above-average comprehension of the material, and for $35 an hour, who could resist? Henceforth, every day in the library I instilled a basic comprehension of rudimentary physics in that boy; to paraphrase Kipling, I was bound in exile to serve my captive’s need. 

As physics is fundamental to the universe, my actions are thus fundamental as well—those who build houses for the homeless or cure cancer cannot also boast of their dominion over the universe’s natural forces. Henceforth, as I counted my $20 bills, I knew true happiness.

##### What is the most significant challenge that society faces today? (50 word limit)

Despite my exemplary work ethic, self-effacing charm, and jocular wit, I am not appreciated enough by my peers. Shakespeare wrote, “some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.” If I were to thrust my greatness more vigorously upon society, society would henceforth be improved.

##### How did you spend your last two summers? (50 word limit)

During the summer of junior year, I was able to dispense my wisdom to compatriots at UCSC as a parrot disperses fruit seeds through its feces. Last summer, I studied financial accounting, a decision which inspired me to make money through the profession henceforth. 

##### What historical moment or event do you wish you could have witnessed? (50 word limit)

I wish I witnessed the Deepwater Horizon oil spill; with its boundless expanses of sickly ebon, the cacophonous cawing of drowning seabirds, the palpable fear of a thousand Greenpeace hacks, henceforth I would feel even more appreciation for humanity’s influence on the universe.  

##### What five words best describe you? (10 word limit)

Jaded, idiosyncratic, quixotic, perspicacious, equanimous 

##### When the choice is yours, what do you read, listen to, or watch? (50 word limit)

I have a recording saved of my eighth-grade graduation, where one of my classmates delivered an appropriately fawning, adulatory paean on my exemplary characteristics. I have treasured that moment, my “rosebud,” if you will, and suitable time has been spent henceforth on reliving that former glory.

##### Name one thing you are looking forward to experiencing at Stanford. (50 word limit)

An environment of peers and professors who will be sophisticated enough to truly appreciate me in my myriad, multifaceted talents; only such a distinguished community of enlightened folks as Stanford will provide the satisfaction I know I deserve. I know henceforth I shall have imparted a once-in-a-lifetime feeling upon them.

##### Imagine you had an extra hour in the day — how would you spend that time? (50 word limit).

Appreciating the finer things in life—the trilling of birdsong on the patio, Don José’s laments in *Carmen*, the luminous radiance of my 500-count bed sheets, authentic tieguanyin from Fujian; this latter gustatory experience has led me to henceforth resolve to enlighten my future peers and broaden their limited horizons. 

##### The Stanford community is deeply curious and driven to learn in and out of the classroom. Reflect on an idea or experience that makes you genuinely excited about learning. (100 to 250 words)

A fundamental truth which my history teachers have imparted on my eager, young mind is that those who do not study the past are doomed to repeat it. I find this a defeatist perspective: history deserves to be reiterated and expanded upon, its fractal forms reprised through posterity. The prospect of being the vanguard of one of these movements, revitalizing and improving what less innovative minds designed before, titillates me; when I first read of the historical figures of yore, Julius Caesar and Napoleon, I henceforth resolved to do what they were incapable of and remodel the world in a better, more harmonious mold. 

This sacred responsibility I have taken upon myself drives my attitude in the classroom: all historical events are fuel for the fire of invention, timber to be sawed together or ground into dust—Hephaestus’ artistry cannot compare to the mental machinations I must go through to stoke the flames of intellectual development. Those of my peers or my gracious mentors who understand this well-reasoned perspective may once rise above their stolid positions as mere teachers or students, and henceforth join me in a brave new world, and those who do not are doomed to fail. At Stanford, I hope all are of the former group.

##### Virtually all of Stanford’s undergraduates live on campus. Write a note to your future roommate that reveals something about you or that will help your roommate — and us — know you better. (100 to 250 words)  

Dear future roommate,

I am excited to meet you, and I know you are excited to meet me. Together, with my guidance, we shall accomplish greatness. 

Sometimes, as I lie in blissful contemplation, I ponder what our purpose in the universe is. I believe some are destined to be the Da Vincis and Teslas, tirelessly exerting themselves trailblazing new paths for all of us; others are the shoe-shiners of the world, content in their oyster to live a simple life, unaware of the value pearls provide. I am of the former group, and I hope you are too.

Still, all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. We must discuss practical matters too, as I will have plenty of time to exchange my pearls of wisdom with yours. Firstly, you must appreciate opera and jazz, as this is what we will listen to; if you disagree, I will help you see the light. Secondly, I am reserving sole access to our mini fridge, sink, mirror, and shower, as unfettered access to these devices preserves my holistic well-being. You are smart, I am sure, so you will cope well.

Often in life we are tested in times of hardship, and we are defined by how we react. I understand this will be a difficult experience for you, expanding your mental horizons, but at some point henceforth we must all learn to swim in the vast ocean of life. I will then be your pool noodle and help you swim, so do not worry. You are not alone.

Best,

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

##### Tell us about something that is meaningful to you and why. (100 to 250 words)

I have a pet term for what most would consider mental refinement, pushing the boundaries of the intellect: “thinkification.” This takes many forms in my daily life: I may thinkify when reading Camus’ *The Stranger* or Ibsen’s *Et Dukkehjem*; I may also thinkify when casually writing poetry (a noble pursuit which like many subjects, I have a natural acuity for). Only a thoroughly thinkified mind could, in the course of its daily dalliances, write such poetry as this ode to soy sauce:

To drink thee in thy inky, ebon form,

Thy flowing drops cascading down my spoon,

The briny fumes a swirling, pounding storm.

My sushi dances through thy dark lagoon,

its salmon, tuna blending into one,

Voracious tides submerging sticky rice;

The bacchanal of feasting has begun!

About this pleasure I’ll remain concise: 

When guzzling flasks of saline liquid gold,

Ambrosial darkness meeting shrouded lore,

I wonder why we scorn our friendly mold—

Oh how I love the aspergillus spore!

If anyone abhors divine soy sauce,

I shake my head and think—gee, what a loss!   

Thinkification is important to me because it best equips me for making the world a better place; only a mind suitably honed on the whetstone of intellectual challenge will develop the vivacity necessary to tackle daily challenges of great importance. Ministers of our intellectual profession like Nietzsche and Kierkegaard may tackle weighty matters of life and death, but if henceforth those of that caliber may thinkify a bit more, they, too, shall be great.

722,f1wzro,False,Other Discussion,76,"Thoughts from a prestige-obsessed freshman, and what made me realize none of this matters",ApplyingToCollege,"Hey everyone, random throwaway here. As a current freshman, A2C helped me a lot last year, especially the posts from then-freshmen sharing their stories, so I figured I would return the favor and share my side of the college proces. I feel like a lot of you guys on this sub have the same prestige-focused mindset I had last year, and I want to let you guys in on a different perspective.


I'm just going to preface this word-vomit with my stats:

1520, 3.8 at a (tier 2) NE prep school, 4.0 first semester in college 


My ECs:

Math Team Captain, MUN head delegate with state awards, and president of a microfinancing club. The only part of my application that actually mattered was the fact that I'm a dual citizen (US and a country in the middle east), I lived abroad for a couple of years, and I'm trilingual (with multiple national awards for one of my languages) 


My story: 

For as long as I can remember, my (first-gen) dad always pushed me to do more. It was a problem in elementary and middle school, but in high school, things really went to shit when his obsession with prestige bubbled up. Every August, like clockwork, he would make me apply to boarding school after boarding school. I spent three god damn years of my life on Exeter and Choate's waitlists (all of 9th, 10th, and 11th grade), and my dad still pushed me to apply as a potential PG last year. His obsession with the prestige of top boarding schools bled over to me, and the prestige (and the validation) became something I obsessed over.


Well, college apps were more of the same thing. He expected me to apply to Ivy's and top LACs, and would shit-talk my top choice because it was a small/niche program at an Ivy, and not a big name program that people would recognize (think Yale-NUS type of program). 


Anyway, come Ivy Day, I didn't get in anywhere and I was devastated. I got into a few decent LACs, but after getting rejected from my top choice, I seriously considered taking a gap year. 


After a while, I realized how big a mistake that would be, and decided on one of my match schools in DC (GW, Go Colonials!). I'm not going to bullshit you guys and say that it's been all sunshine and rainbows, and I have thought about transferring, but in a lot of ways, coming to DC has been the best decision of my life. 

A lot of the people I've met in college are just as fake as people I knew in high school, but the nice thing about college is that literally no body cares. Once you're in the door, whether it's at Harvard or anywhere else, everyone is so focused on their own pursuits that there's no time for the petty bullshit I dealt with last year. 


For me, what really cracked the rose colored glasses of prestige was realizing the opportunities mid tier schools can offer their top students. My best friend, who's now at Brown, had the highest GPA in the history of my school. Now, he's around the middle of the pack. I, on the other hand, was barely in the top 20%, but at GW I made Dean's list and get access to tons of special crap. 


Because of my academic standing (which I wouldn't have at an Ivy), I get priority registration for tons of events (I got to see Nikki Haley, Ronan Farrow, and a few other really cool speakers last semester), and first dibs at internships and networking opportunities. Right now, I'm writing this post on my lunch break in one of the Congressional cafeterias, because I was able to snag a last-minute internship on the Hill 3 days/week. This is not the kind of thing I ever imagined would be possible this time last year, to me, getting rejected from Ivy's meant that I was doomed to a life of mediocrity, which I've realized is so absurd and overblown. 


TLDR: Think you'll get rejected from an Ivy? Who cares, you'll just end up being a top student and kicking ass somewhere else",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/f1wzro/thoughts_from_a_prestigeobsessed_freshman_and/,1106,[deleted] ,2020-02-10 21:11:04

***Some personal updates within the 24 hours:***

\- Found my passports, social security card (I didn't know my number, but will memorize it), and some other documents (got all of them scanned & will hide it somewhere else)

\- Wrote an email to colleges about the procedure to appealing aid (I don't know exactly what to do as a lot of people write about getting their request rejected, not on the procedure itself)

\- Looked at the scholarship list (thanks u/lune-etoile), found one scholarship that is for me! (going to see my principal soon so she can write me a letter of recommendation)

\- My friend's mom offered me two part time jobs tutoring kids (big plus since I only work 6hrs/week rn) It also coincides on the time the job that my mom was forcing me to do, so yay!

~~- Also got a new bank account (kakaobank), but apparently it's a limited bank account(한도제한계좌)? Fellow Koreans please come through as in how to change this? 어떤 서류 필요해요??~~

Don't worry guys, again, I'm used to this. This ain't my first rodeo. Also, I didn't withdraw from any colleges, if you guys were wondering. Thank god I hesitated, otherwise, I would've lost everything. I have 6 colleges to hear back from this week (I think).

And thanks for the nice & helpful comments. ***You guys really made my day.***

p.s. If you guys have other scholarships/schools that I could apply to, please let me know. I'm a U.S. dual citizen (Korean/U.S. citizen) currently living in Korea. My major is biomedical engineering/bio-engineering.

p.s.s. I'm trying to buy a new laptop by saving some of my money. When should I buy it? Should I get it asap or buy it once I'm on campus?

***update***: hey guys, thanks for reaching out. sorry if I don’t reply to your DMs fast enough. I’m cleaning the house right now 😂😂 Having a dog is pretty messy.

A lot of you guys have told me to try filing for dependency override, but I still have my dad who’s income is way bigger than moms (cuz she got her hours cut for getting a face lift lol). So I don’t think that will work.

Right now, I emailed the colleges, as most of them seemed to close their campuses. Also the time difference makes it super hard for me to call them. But nonetheless, I will call them sooner or later.

***Also, no need to venmo/paypal me***. Instead, please donate to the red cross or a respectable health organization. I need this corona gone, so my hours can be extended (I currently teach 2 kids English, but my boss said that when schools start again, I should expect to get more hours).

EDIT TLDR: Enjoy having little responsibilities.


I know most of you young seniors can’t wait to get out of highschool, but really, cherish your senior year. Don’t get me wrong, I’m a sophomore in college and it’s loads more fun than highschool, but I would be lying (along with like everyone else I know) if I said I didn’t miss being a high schooler. I know it sounds like I want to relive glory days or whatever, but really, life becomes a lot more difficult in college and you actually have real responsibilities and essentially become an adult. Enjoy your senior year, don’t go too ham, have some fun with it, it will be the last year you truly at to be a “kid”. 


On another note, don’t stress if you don’t attend like an Ivy League because the truth is, it doesn’t matter. If you are attending a good university, ranging from like A&M to Harvard, there are no closed doors for you. Every oppurtunity that exist graduating from Harvard would exist for any other “good” college as well, at that point employers don’t care too much where you attended since they both give you a sufficient education, they care more about how you did there, and how you as a person will fit into their team.

735,bmqo1x,False,None,96,i turned down a private admissions counselor who had gotten 100+ students into hypsm & other ramblings about college admissions,ApplyingToCollege,"edited to remove some personal info.

several disclaimers: i love my parents. i know they are acting out of what they think are my best interests in subjects they think they know better than i do. and i trust their judgment, and i am truly grateful for all they’ve done for me. i think we just have a fundamental misalignment of our values. second, i know how lucky i am. the programs i’ve been able to attend, the connections afforded by my parents, all of these things helped me bring me to where i am now. with that said, thank you guys for reading this rambley rant!

during junior year my parents encouraged me to work with a private admissions counselor. he had had huge success rates in getting students (especially asian americans) into hypsm, ivy’s/t20’s, etc.

he emphasized how choosy he was but that he would be glad to work with me. i instinctively turned him down; not only would it have cost $10,000, i didn’t feel right doing it.

my parents tried to get me to work with him for weeks, saying they were fine with the cost (which i knew they were — i’m fortunate enough to have a family that prioritizes my college education). i kept telling them that was too much to pay (and i still think that it is, to be honest) but that wasn’t the main reason. i just imagined myself opening up that decision letter and seeing the rejection, seeing myself wasting $10,000 that my parents invested in me. or even worse, seeing the acceptance and knowing that colleges hadn’t admitted ME, they had admitted this snobby, polished version of me, with ten caked layers of makeup and plastic surgery.

after that summer, i was a bit more confident about the college process. i had done a lot of introspection, a lot of soul searching. my parents tried getting me to work with the counselor again; he said that he was willing to make an exception to work with me last minute but would raise the price to $15,000. the idea of anyone making that kind of transaction sickened me. he made me do an interview with him and all i could think the entire time was, why are you profiting off a twisted system that already favors the rich and are now tilting it even more in their favor?

needless to say, i didn’t work with him. flash foward a few months, i had gotten rejected from almost all the ivy’s, including my dream school. we went to an admitted student day at a t20, but not one i had particular interest in, and on the way there, my dad asked me if i regretted not working with the counselor.

but you know what? i still don’t regret it. the college admissions process is twisted beyond belief. the elite schools profit off the rich while shoving the few minority or low income students in your face in some facade of diversity. and yeah, these schools have a decently diverse student group and help low income students who make it in break out of the cycle of poverty, but all in all, the admissions process is a shitshow. it’s all a transaction, and maybe it’s not always the monetary kind, but the manipulation of the admissions process and the inequity of it all absolutely sickens me.

i’m not saying anyone who worked with counselors is a bad person, or that every college consultant is a scam, but as a personal choice, i’d rather be at a disadvantage than use money to get myself ahead. the counselor i would’ve worked with wouldn’t have written my essays or anything of the sort, but i’d be spending my parents’ money for some glossy essays — not something that would actually help me grow as a person. over these past few months i’ve realized that i don’t really care about the rankings of schools and all of that anymore. if you have the drive, you’ll succeed. it’s as easy as that.

tldr; i turned down a $10-15k admissions counselor and a better chance at the ivy’s because i thought it was immoral and didn’t want to contribute to wealth inequality in college admissions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bmqo1x/i_turned_down_a_private_admissions_counselor_who/,1100,"What absolute insanity.

I still can’t believe parents like your own believe these things. It makes me question whether Asians very high iq (only below Ashkenazi) means anything at all.

737,cd8d7y,False,None,11,PSA for fellow males: Check if your country of origin or citizenship practices conscription,ApplyingToCollege,"[Map here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Conscription_map_of_the_world.svg)

If you hold a citizenship in any of these countries, you may be legally obligated to perform military service. In some countries, you will have no other option, while some will offer alternate service.

As someone who has looked into this matter extensively, I can offer some tips. These are not universal, and I am not and have never been a conscript. Your experience will differ from country to country.

1st. This is not a light matter. People have died from hazing, stress, and accidents (Korea and Russia being prime examples). You are not going off to summer camp. These programs do not care about you. They are built to create a large fighting reserve, and will use you however they wish.

2nd. You will be severely hampered in your future plans. Most conscripts will not be able to leave their base for extended periods of time, and you will usually be cut off from the rest of the world. 2 years might not sound long, but it is in fact 2.5% of your life gone. And that 2.5% is in your prime.

3rd. The world will not stop when you are gone. Your friends will have made newer friends and had newer experiences. Popular culture will have shifted. New shows, movies, and books will have come out. No one will bend over backwards to accommodate you, beyond allowing you to return to some version of your previous life.

4th. You will be broken down. To me, the shaving of hair is an extremely symbolic act. When I was young and in India, my hair was cut short to impose upon me a sense of uniformity, and strip from me parts of my individuality. Not only will you most likely be shaved, you will be drilled and taught to conform to team dynamics. You will be instilled with a sense of detachment from your personal beliefs.

5th. You will not be paid well. You will also most likely not receive any benefits. This is not the US military. If you have some fanciful idea of service with civilians saluting you as you collect your regular benefits and enjoy a prestigious post in life, get that idea out of your head. Being fair, you will be provided accommodation and food, but don’t expect either to be particularly good.

6th. There is no equality (unless you are in Norway or, to a lesser degree, Israel). Don’t expect to see women serving alongside you. You will be expected to give up these years of your life for the sole virtue of being born male. They do not care for equality. If you complain about it, you will be ridiculed.

Here is my recommendation: 

Humans are not made to be turned into cannon fodder. They should not be herded or forced to potentially kill. They should not be tasked with laying down their lives for the rest of society. They should not be subject to harsh conditions and used as slave labor. Their individuality should be respected. Discipline and sense of belonging are neither guaranteed nor always desirable.

If you have any legal avenue of leaving the country and renouncing your citizenship, do it. Life expectancy is not a guarantee. You do not know if you will be alive for the next sixty years. If you die in three years, do you really want to have spent two in the bone chilling cold, shoveling snow?

Many of these countries will allow you to defer service if you are in higher education. Countries such as Canada and New Zealand are known for giving preference for permanent residence to those who graduated from domestic universities.

If you have religious beliefs, you might even try applying for refugee status. Certain communities, such as Jehovah’s Witnesses, have been known to be targets of such systems despite their refusal to serve in any military capacity. Reach out to religious organizations and they might be able to help. For atheists, you can also try to look for pacifist organizations that might support you due to their opposition to war.

If you are in the US, you have most likely registered for Selective Service. While the draft has not been active in 4 decades, males aged 18-26 have to register. If you are already 18, make sure you register or you may be ineligible for federal benefits and may be fined for $250,000. Prosecution is uncommon, but do not risk it. Furthermore, write to your Congressman to support either the abolishment of Selective Service or extend it to women on equal terms.

I am not a lawyer. I am not a legal expert. I am not advising you to commit any hasty action. I am simply raising awareness of the matter. Your life is yours. Please never forget that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/cd8d7y/psa_for_fellow_males_check_if_your_country_of/,1092,"On the one hand, this is a very good warning to put out there. Obviously there was a thread from a Korean-American earlier who was forced into conscription in Korea despite no connection with the country or knowledge of the requirement. You should be aware of conscription requirements, and, if the country that wants to draft you is not one to which you feel a particularly personal connection, renounce your citizenship.

But I don’t understand the heavy anti-military attitude this post adopts. Israel, for example, is a country with a small population surrounded by threats. Where do you think it would be without mandatory conscription? If you’re Israeli, Israel is your country just as much as everyone else’s. It expends its resources to keep you safe and comfortable, and if you walk down the street, odds are you’ll see someone who lost a loved one defending *you*. Most consider it an honor to serve, and when you consider the sacrifices the country and its military have gone through so that you can live freely, you should want to do your part to repay your country. 

Most of this subreddit is American. Most of us probably won’t serve in the military, but we will be legally obligated to register for Selective Service. And if it happens that we are under some threat that justifies a draft, I would hope that we can all recognize what America has given us and fulfill our obligation to give back.

In all cases, it’s not about gender, though most countries regard women as less qualified for service and limit or eliminate their obligations, a huge controversy in a lot of them. I am of the opinion that it should apply equally to all, but as long as the Selective Service in America remains sort of meaningless, I don’t see this issue becoming a major controversy. While other countries do practice mandatory conscription and apply it to only men, that’s merely reflective of differing cultural perspectives. No matter who is exempted in your country, you’re not being punished for being a man, or for being born there. You’re being asked to do whatever you can to help your country overcome some threat, because it’s that country that has provided your freedom for all of your life.

Service also yields many personal benefits. It creates close relationships, and helps you to gain important life skills. In Israel, many consider their service to have contributed the skills that enable a lot of them to thrive in jobs with major technology companies. There’s a reason that mandatory conscription continues even in democratic countries bound to the will of constituents.

I’m not trying to argue that you should be forced to serve in a military with whose practices you disagree; for residents of certain countries, it’s debatable whether the military protects them or is the very force from whom they need protection. But a lot of the countries that practice mandatory conscription are not these countries; they’re countries that will serve you for an entire lifetime and rely on you to reciprocate a bit. If your religion prevents service, or you have no real connection to the country asking it of you, by all means find an appropriate legal path to avoid your service; many countries will allow you to replace your military service with community service for those reasons, and renouncing citizenship is an option too if you don’t feel a true connection to the country. I’m also not trying to argue that mandatory conscription is a good thing everywhere; in peacetime, a volunteer force makes by far the most sense. Still, countries like Israel and South Korea don’t have the luxury of being able to survive on a volunteer force.

If you don’t like your military treatment, there are NGOs that will help, though this post seems to imply that you will not earn respect for your service and will have no connection to the outside world, which is not true. You can indeed talk to your friends and family and watch popular shows, most people will respect you for dedicating some of your life to defending them, and understanding how to be disciplined and how to act under high stress are very useful skills. Countries do care about their soldiers; Israel has literally traded prisoners for the bodies of fallen soldiers to hold proper Jewish funerals, for which tens of strangers will show up to pay respect and ensure that even those without a wide friendship base have a minyan. You also should realize that you’re probably not going to be thrown into the front lines; for most of this subreddit, medical or intelligence options would likely be preferred, and they do exist. 

If you have unique circumstances like dual citizenship or religious beliefs that prevent service, then find a way out of it. Equality of military service is also a very noble fight and writing to your officials is a great way to get there. But fleeing the country that has sacrificed everything to give you and your family a good, comfortable life because you’re “not cannon fodder” when they need you to reciprocally help them is simply inappropriate.

749,b73rci,False,None,111,"AOs Can't Actually Detect ""Authenticity"" Or ""Passion"": Hot Take From A Stanford Senior",ApplyingToCollege,"(on a throwaway)

&#x200B;

A week before my freshman year of high school, my (overbearing) Asian parents took me to a private college counselor's office. This person used to be an AO at Stanford, quit her job, and now spends her time coaching students to build the perfect resume to get into super selective colleges.

""So, what do you like to do in your free time?""

""I like hiking and naturery stuff"" I said.

""That's not academic enough. Anything else?""

""Uh idk. I like art I guess,"" I choked.

&#x200B;

After some humming and hawing and lots of googling things on her laptop, my counselor told me that I needed to do something ""community-minded"" with my interests. ""How about starting an art collective for low-income neighborhoods of color?"" she suggested. **It seemed like she literally just pulled out some ""buzzwords"" that would look good on my resume,** and I wasn't too interested in the prospect. I stared at her for a solid 30 seconds before my mom said ""yes, (my name) would love to do that.""

&#x200B;

I remember this moment so clearly because 1. It was the decision to pursue the activity that probably got me into Stanford, and 2. I knew I wasn't interested in it from the very beginning, but I also knew that AOs would never catch my lack of interest. I mean are they mind readers? Of course not. For the record, lots of my supplements (including my Stanford one) talked about how ""I was driven to empower students from East San Jose/ Oakland from the beginning of my journey,"" but clearly, that's not the case. And AOs never noticed, **as both my Stanford and Yale regional AO gave me hand-written, physical notes in my acceptance packages telling me how they ""could just feel my enthusiasm for using art as a praxis of empowerment.""**

&#x200B;

So yeah, ""an art collective for low-income neighborhoods of color""... I emailed a couple local non profits. I started teaching oil painting and creative writing to poor middle schoolers at an after school club. I liked it, but it probably wasn't something I'd pursue on my own without the motivation of college admissions. It got big. *Sophomore year, I got super-competitive grants from 3 well-recognized foundations. Junior year, I got an award from Princeton and another award from a really big non profit recognizing me for my efforts.* **But we all know that I wasn't truly passionate about this.**

&#x200B;

**So what happens after high school graduation?** The kids who run foundations/ non-profits/ programs, at least in my super competitive silicon valley suburb, don't go on to keep up this facade for the rest of their lives (why would they?). Most of the kids in my area, myself included, went on to major in econ/CS and sell our souls out to a giant tech company/ investment bank/ consulting firm after graduation. **Despite our liberal political inclinations, few Stanford students graduate and truly go on to advocate for the communities they supposedly dedicated themselves to in high school.** Sure, there are some exceptions.

&#x200B;

But for the most part, there's a huge campus mentality of ""ditching your high school self"" and ""getting to live a little for the next 4 years"" on the Farm because **a good portion of us--especially unhooked applicants like myself--spent almost all of our high school years to get into schools like Stanford.** (There was actually a book written by a Yale professor about this phenomena: Excellent Sheep by William Deresiewicz. Highly recommend you read the book if you're a senior trying to decide between a selective and a non-selective school atm).

&#x200B;

That's why I'm always confused and angry when AOs and some admissions counselors like u/admissionsmom (I think she's amazing, just wrong on this one aspect) say ""just follow your passion"" and ""we can tell when applicants do ECs they aren't passionate about"" or ""to get into HPYS, you have to be genuinely interested in what you do;"" and the worst one, ""be authentic! AOs can tell when you aren't being yourself."" **No, they can't.** They can only tell when 1. You're using cliched tropes, and 2. You aren't as successful in your endeavors as you could've been. ***Stanford, and nearly any ultra selective college for that matter, is full of kids who are incredibly successful but not necessarily passionate in what they did in high school.***

&#x200B;

So if any underclassmen are reading this, just remember: **if you're aiming for HYPS, aim for excellence--not necessarily authenticity.** I mean if I spent my high school years doing what I loved the most, I would've spent them hiking, painting (I'm decent at it but not good enough to get Stanford's attention), writing (ditto with painting) and getting high. That most likely wouldn't have led me to Stanford.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: **If you got rejected from your dream schools this week don't feel bad**\--despite what AOs say, they cannot truly determine the emotional investment you've poured into your ECs or academics.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/b73rci/aos_cant_actually_detect_authenticity_or_passion/,1089,"I think for the most part you're completely right, but I got into an ivy this week without doing anything disingenuously.

However, this process has really really helped me discover who I truly am. I have explored myself like never before. I feel like I have an identity now. I feel more mature, more aware of the world around me.

773,eauhdw,False,None,39,Unrealistic expectations really got me,ApplyingToCollege,"Today I was deferred from MIT and Caltech and when I found out the news I was doing great with it. Even though I had really wanted to attend one of those two schools, I recognized that as long as I put my best effort into creating the application that authentically reflects who I am, decisions are out of my control.  I say I *was* doing fine since other people’s reactions were what really upset me.

The problem for applicants who get rejected from top schools, in my mind, is that the people who know them think their acceptance is a forgone conclusion. As someone with high test scores, national/international awards, good grades, everyone around me seems to think I’m the perfect student. This creates a toxic attitude, particularly within my South Asian family. My mom literally told me today “I’m taking this hard because I’m not accustomed to your failure.” Even a friend texted me “Have you heard the good news yet?” 

I’m accustomed to my own failure: losing critical debate rounds, having months of research amount to nothing, etc., which should have made this easier. But when everyone around me is fixated on my perfection, it feels horrible to let them down. I know their expectations that highly competitive schools are (in the words of another friend) “a slam dunk” for me are unrealistic, but not meeting these expectations that everyone seems to have is crushing.

Two pieces of advice that I think we all could use. 1) Students who didn’t get into their dream school want support, not consolation. They don’t want to hear about how good they were or how they should have gotten in. That only makes it worse. 2) Don’t create unrealistic expectations for your peers. College apps are more competitive now than ever, so even if you think you’re complimenting someone by assuming they’ll get into their reach school, you’re just creating an even more toxic environment.

Tl;dr: Not getting in sucks even worse when everyone unrealistically assumed you would.

777,d1hmal,False,None,77,a message to those applying to college right now,ApplyingToCollege,"hey, seniors. i know it’s a really stressful time of the year and it feels like your entire life depends on how to gift wrap all the hard work you did the past several years..

i was in your shoes a year ago. damn, i depended my life on college admissions and applications. it’s all i talked about, it’s all my “friends” talked about, it’s all my parents talked about. 

as if it’s life or death. terminologies like t20, t10, legacy, scores, ranking, fafsa,..all of it stressed the shit out of me.

it felt like if i don’t get into a certain level of a school then i’m pretty much fucked for life or something, you know? like if i don’t get into a t10 i’ll think, fuck, i could’ve been this or that and now i’ll never get that chance. just because i missed 30 points on the sat and didn’t get this score, just because i didn’t stay up the extra couple hours to study for the ap exams. 

but honestly, although i’m only a freshman at uni now, i don’t think that’s the case. it definitely is not. 

&#x200B;

your school and the value is what you make of it. sure, the label of a prestigious school can help. but what’s more important is the experience and the quality of it. 

and once you go to the school you choose, you won’t think back and hate yourself for not studying harder for the sat’s or ap’s or revising your essays more. you’ll be so caught up in the moment trying to make most of what you have in front of you and as long as you make it really worth it for you, it’ll be worth so much more than being accepted into some ivy or a goal school of yours. 

because from now you are focusing on what’s ahead of you and what you have now. and by all means, try your hardest to get into the school that you want to go to. don’t hold yourself back. what i’m trying to say is, don’t stress so much about what you could miss out on. focus on what you got. don’t look at what other’s have because everyone will deal with what they have differently. focus on you, what you want, and what you can do with what you have. 

don’t beat yourself up for not being “good enough” because there is no such thing. you are. you are all unique and have your strengths and ambitions and no school is “perfect” or the “best” for anything. 

&#x200B;

i’m a bit of a hypocrite and sometimes i think about how i could’ve gotten in somewhere better but honestly that has not helped me. being upset about it. instead, i'm getting involved on campus and building myself up so i can create myself. i don't have to make this school define me but i can create experiences of my own. i think that's what's most important. 

&#x200B;

good luck to you all. and don't forget you all have done an incredible job getting to this point. give yourself some credit and don't be so hard on yourselves. whatever happens, you will be fine. you'll be happy.

782,fpknny,False,Essays,52,The absolute stupidest essay that got my friend into Carnegie Mellon,ApplyingToCollege,"Proof that going full tweak gets u into genius schools

Prompt:
Consider your application as a whole. What do you personally want to emphasize about your application for the admission committee's consideration? Highlight something that's important to you or something you haven't had a chance to
share. Tell us, don't show us (no websites please).

Response:
One thing I would like to emphasize that is extremely important to me is my intense disdain for everything Andrew Carnegie stood for. As a person who believes that the American Dream should be accessible to everyone who is willing to work for it, Carnegie's actions in the American steel industry could never be justified in my eyes. 

Andrew Carnegie was the son of a humble immigrant steelworker. Never would any respectable person ever expect him to be the monster he inevitably became. ""Robber baron"" does not begin to describe the total absence of decency in any corner of his empty criminal soul. He mercilessly monopolized American steel and destroyed the lives of the American middle-class. 

I strongly believe in the idea that businesses should not be able to monopolize an industry as it gives them too much control over the lives of the people who require the resources it produces. As such l can only condemn Andrew Canegie as a man, despite his contributions to social welfare through his building of libraries and schools. While his legacy may be greater
than just his worst qualities, his despicable actions and crimes against the common American
man were too much to forgive. His workers were underpaid and worked in horrible conditions.
His brutal exploitation of his workforce was all to only contribute to building the monstrous steel
throne that Carnegie attempted to build for himself.

Regardless of my undying loathing for Andrew Carnegie, I do not wish to live at odds
with any person, living or dead. I would hope that by attending the university Carnegie founded
over 100 years ago I can reconcile my differences with the Ghost of Andrew Carnegie, and I
could once again be at peace with the word.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fpknny/the_absolute_stupidest_essay_that_got_my_friend/,1060,But Carnegie was a philanthropist who donated millions to fund libraries and schools.

784,gm1jbc,False,Rec Letters,209,Letters Of Recommendation 101,ApplyingToCollege,"It’s that time of year where everyone has to request letters of recommendation, except now it’s **extra** awkward since you can’t even ask in person! Here’s everything you need to know about letters of recommendation.


&nbsp;


**What are letters of recommendation? (Yes, this is a 101 post, so EVERYTHING you need to know will be included)**

Letters of recommendation (in the context of applying to college) are letters written by other people, which support your college application. They’re written by your teachers and guidance counselors, but sometimes also by coaches, bosses, and even your peers. Colleges use them to learn about you as a student, but also about your personal qualities (the transcript can tell them how you are as a student). According to Yale, recommenders “write about such things as your intellectual curiosity, energy, relationships with classmates, and impact on the classroom environment. Obviously it is important to ask for recommendations from teachers who know you well.” 


As a rule of thumb, most schools ask for 2 teacher recommendations, 1 guidance counselor recommendation, and some schools will allow you to submit an extra recommendation (from a coach, boss, peer, etc.). 


&nbsp;


**How do I pick which teachers to ask?**


In general, it doesn’t really matter what subjects they teach. What’s much more important is your relationship with the teachers. This teacher should be able to talk about to your personality, work ethic, and interests beyond simply saying that you got good grades.

**Do**: pick a teacher that you have rapport with, or who is involved in some way outside the classroom (perhaps they are your sports coach, or your supervisor for one of your clubs). 

**Don’t**: pick a teacher just because you aced their class. If the teacher doesn’t have anything interesting to say about you, even though you did well in their class, it would be better if you picked another teacher. 

**What if I’m kinda quiet and don’t have a great relationship with any of my teachers and it’s kinda weird now that we’re online?**: ideally, the teachers that you are asking for a rec are involved outside of just a single class. If you see them in a club, or a sport, then continue to build your relationship once school reopens (hopefully). Alternatively, you could build a relationship with your senior year teachers, and ask them to write your recommendation. If neither of these work, then don’t stress. Even if your relationship with the teachers isn’t the best, you can greatly improve their recommendation by giving them the tools they need to write you a glowing letter. 


&nbsp;


**Okay, okay, tell me. How do I get my teachers to write me a banger rec?**


First, you want to include a brief resume. This should have your ECs, academic stats, awards, and anything else that you're proud of or want to include (whether those are your interests that aren’t fully fleshed ECs, like reading, woodworking, fitness, etc. or any extenuating circumstances)

You also want to prepare a Q&A letter that will help your recommender truly personalize your rec. I was lucky enough to have my teachers explicitly state what they wanted me to write about, but here’s the gist of the questions. 

* “Is there anything specific you would like me to write about?” (If you want them to address something you find important, here is the place). 

* “Describe any important or relevant extracurriculars and what you’ve learned.” This is important because your teachers probably don’t have a great idea of what you do outside of class, and can use this information to talk about it in a more insightful way. 

* “Describe how you did in my class, as well as any challenges faced or obstacles overcome. If there is a single time that you felt like you excelled in the class, then describe it.” Reminder: your teacher probably teaches a lot of students. This is more to jog their memory so that they can specifically write YOUR letter (especially since you’ll probably be out of their class by the time they actually write it). 


&nbsp;


**Sure, but we’re online right now. How do I actually ASK for a rec?**

If your classes are still online, my personal recommendation would be to stay behind, and just ask like you would if you were in person. Ask if they would be willing to write a letter of recommendation for you, and give them a couple reasons why you think they would be a good fit--perhaps you two have a good relationship, or you’ve really been challenged by the class, etc.


You could also do it via email. Here, I’ve ripped off u/ScholarGrade’s example of what your email should look like: 

> ""Hi Mr. Smith, I've really enjoyed your class and it's one of the reasons I want to major in Chemistry at MIT. I feel like you made it real and exciting and so much more than just an academic subject - it’s become a passion of mine. Would you be willing to write a recommendation letter for my college application?""

> ""Here's a resume for your reference. Just a heads up – I'm planning to apply to eight colleges and several scholarships as well, so I will probably be coming back to you for more copies in the next couple of months. Let me know if you have any questions. I really appreciate you doing this – at selective schools like MIT, a detailed and specific recommendation letter can make a big difference. Thanks again!""


&nbsp;


**Okay, I asked for a rec and they said yes. Now what?**

* **Let your recommenders know what colleges you are applying to, as well as the earliest deadline.** It’s okay if you don’t have a full list, you can always update them later. The important part is that your teacher knows the latest by when they can get their recommendation in. Nowadays, however, most recommendation letters are done digitally, so the teacher only has to submit one copy and a system will automatically send it to every college. Every school is different: figure out what your school does. 

* **Follow up with your recommender as the deadline gets closer.** Ideally, your recommender will get it in much before the deadline, but following up ensures that you don’t stress if they submit it the day of or even late.


&nbsp;


**Do I need 1 STEM and 1 humanities rec?**

Contrary to popular belief, it doesn't matter much what subjects your recommenders teach. It may be a bit strange if you apply for a STEM major but only have humanities recs or vice versa, but in general, pick teachers that you have a good relationship with. The only time where you should actively seek 1 STEM and 1 humanities rec is if a specific school asks for that. 


&nbsp;


**What about my counselor rec?**


You would go about a similar process--send them your resume, a quick Q&A sheet about yourself (minus the specifics about your class), and check in with them to make sure they get your rec in on time. To be completely honest, counselor recs don’t matter much unless they’re highly positive, address extenuating circumstances, or negative. 


**EDIT**: A comment by u/BlaqOptic [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gm1jbc/letters_of_recommendation_101/fr2uw3q/) explains more in depth the use of counselor recommendations. In summary, they provide important context to course rigor/selection as well as your activities.


* **Highly positive**: if your counselor describes you as one of the brightest kids to ever come through the school, or if you are literally a ray of sunshine that is kind to everyone and is loved by everyone, then colleges will make note of that. This is somewhat hard to convey in your own essays because it seems like bragging.

* **Address extenuating circumstances**: by having your guidance counselor explain circumstances, it gives more credibility to the issue, and also indicates that the impact was significant enough to be worth explaining. 

* **Negative**: negative recommendations are extremely rare, but even a single one can sink your entire app. Admissions officers want kids whose teachers/counselors will advocate for them wholeheartedly. 


&nbsp;


**Do recommendations even matter that much?**

Similar to the guidance counselor rec, these recommendations don’t matter too much unless they’re highly positive, address extenuating circumstances or are negative. 


* **How do I avoid getting a negative rec?**: first and foremost, if a teacher ever seems hesitant to write you a rec when you ask them, it would probably not be best for them to write it. Good teachers will decline to write you a rec if they feel they cannot talk about you in a good way. The best way to ensure that you avoid a negative rec is by picking teachers who you are close with, and have a lot to say about you. 


&nbsp;


**Okay, last question, I swear. What the hell is the FERPA thing?**

FERPA is used to protect the privacy of students' educational records. In the context of letters of recommendations, FERPA gives you the right to view your letters of recommendation once you have been admitted to college. However, most teachers and schools require you to waive your FERPA rights, essentially meaning that you agree to not view your letter of recommendation. This shows that you trust your teacher and seems more honest to admissions officers. In fact, admissions officers will usually be concerned if you **don't** waive your FERPA rights. It signals that you don't trust your teachers. 


&nbsp;


**TL;DR** Start asking for recs soon, pick teachers who you have good relationships with, give them the tools they need to make it specialized, and avoid getting a bad rec.

There are certain kids at my school who are known to be smart & hardworking students. He wasn't one of them, at all. He had some good ECs related to his major & interests (poli-sci with the goal of going to law school), but didn't have that great of stats. He decided to apply to UChicago ED because of how much weight they put on their essays and their reputation for taking chances on students with slightly worse-than-average stats. He then came up with plausible-sounding fake extenuating circumstances. A kid at school had died freshman year after being hit by a drunk driver, so he claimed he was best friends with this kid and became deeply depressed after his death, contributing to a bad GPA. Our counselor presumably didn't know they weren't actually friends because our school is huge, and so corroborated this in her rec letters. He also worked this into his essays by saying it was this accident that sparked his interest in activism/law. 

The facts? He hated that kid and didn't care *at all* when he died.

He ended up getting in ED. Not only did he literally use someone's death to his benefit, he also basically took away attention from all the kids who actually worked hard to get in. 

It just goes to show how the whole process goes to twist people. I know this guy, and unless he's a super good actor or something, he's not some sort of sociopath. He's an average, normally actually really nice guy, and this process changed him into a guy who literally bragged about how smart he was for using someone's death to his advantage.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ggt9ah/someone_at_my_school_lied_about_being_best/,1056,"To be fair, those are skills needed for someone who want to get into laws/politics ",2020-05-10 02:38:08

\-Apply to match schools. Don't be me and only apply to uber safety and uber reach schools.

\-Don't obsess over your decisions. Seriously, try not to do it. I spent so much time checking this sub to see if likely letters were out for X school or if everyone had gotten Y email, and it was such a waste. Send your apps in and try your best to focus on other things.

\-Someone told me this, and it helped me a lot: The best school isn't necessarily the best school for YOU. Prestige is not king. You can still be happy and successful and awesome if you don't go to a highly ranked school.

\-For me, money was my #1 factor. I got into higher ranked schools than the one I chose, but I could not afford them (and I also got rejected from a lot of higher ranked schools  lmao). This is another reason a ""better school"" doesn't make someone better. I was so obsessed with prestige, but it's really so stupid.

A year ago I read posts like these that said things like these, and I kind of brushed it off because all I was focused on was getting into the best ranked college possible, but I was focusing on entirely on the wrong thing to the point where I was missing opportunities to better myself and succeed.

Through this process, just keep everything in perspective. Your hard work and character are not defined or questioned by your admissions decisions. Enjoy this year as much as you can, and focus your energy only on what you have control over.

I am an incoming college freshman. Before I tell you where I am going, here are my stats:

SAT: 1230
ACT: 25
GPA: 4.2

I came from a low income household, so much so to the point where I was supporting myself my last year of high school, working insane hours to pay for my college application fees, graduation cap and gown, etc. 

I hated school until I was in sophomore year, when a teacher told me if I didn't get my shit together, I wouldn't graduate. I started to study, and actually cared about the grades I got. The only access to a computer I had at the time was to the public library. I actually transferred high schools, because I wanted to become more academically driven at a college prep school (despite the rumors from classmates that I got expelled from my previous school). 

The highest job my mom ever held was a shift supervisor at Carl's Jr. The highest job my (long gone) dad ever held was a drug dealer. 

I worked 6 months prior on my essays to colleges, and worked so hard for my extracurriculars that I had 500+ hours of community service. 

I got rejected from these colleges: UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara, UC Berkeley, Cal Poly SLO, San Diego State, Cornell, Brown, Stanford, USC.

CSUN, Cal State Long Beach, **UCLA.**

I got accepted as a Biology major, and am attending this fall. So if you think you have a zero percent chance, that is bullshit. The college decisions are wack- of course you have a chance.

807,gzi2ti,False,Rant,122,Struggling with superiority complex after being rejected by all colleges I applied to,ApplyingToCollege,"Hi all! Semi-rant here, don't know where this will go but screw it.

I grew up in a relatively small town where I was considered the smartest in my school from elementary to 10th grade. My teachers praised my intelligence and my immigrant parents were confident I could get into Ivy schools like MIT. Every time we'd watch TV shows like Fringe or any sciencey media where the character goes to some prestigious college, my mom would make a point to say it out loud and give me a smirk that said ""that's your future right there, better get excited!"" Same for irl people for that matter: she would tell me about her friend's child who got into MIT, and constantly remind me that she herself went to the most prestigious college in their country by earning perfect marks on her math exams, and that I could *easily* do the same here in the U.S. I was naive to believe them; after all, I've been told my entire life if I work hard then anything can be achieved, right?

Fast forward to junior year of high school, my parents moved to California in order to qualify for in-state tuition for UCs (I know, this is sort of cheating the system financially i guess? but that's beside the point). Holy moly, I was suddenly thrust into a high school that was twice as large as my previous one, and a relatively intense high school at that. Pretty much everyone had 5+ AP classes and were involved intensely in some extracurricular activity, such as being national chess champions, national math competition winners, you name it. Everyone felt like a character in an anime that had exaggerated, outlandish talents, except they were real.

I quickly felt drowned out. I went from being known and praised by all my teachers and friends as THE SMARTEST, to insignificant and lame. I hadn't taken any AP classes up until that point, and due to conflicts with classes taken at my previous school, I couldn't take AP classes even if I wanted to because I lacked the prerequisites. I was placed in a math class that I breezed through without paying attention at all in class because the upper classes were full, and they rejected my appeal to a higher physics class because they felt ""i wasn't ready"", despite myself knowing I could learn math quickly. I felt ignored and snubbed. ""No one knows what I'm capable of"" I fumed to myself, developing a cynical view of all the students at my school whom I viewed as pompous and self righteous. I ended up self studying for the AP Computer Science and AP Calculus BC tests in my junior year, because I felt my new school obviously treated me like I wasn't capable.

Despite this, I felt like I had sufficient merits by senior year. After all, I had a 1560 SAT, 4.0+ GPA, enrollment and leadership in clubs and extracurriculars, awards from state coding/math competitions, and a GitHub repo that showcased my years of experience with programming. I applied to CalTech, MIT, Berkeley, Stanford, and others. In my naive mind, I thought Berkeley would be my match school. My SAT score and GPA was in the higher range, right?

Fast forward again to two months later, I had been rejected by all my schools, and waitlisted at the school that I considered my safety.

As fervently as my parents had put these Ivy schools on a pedestal, they then turned around and blamed the system, espousing that these people only got in through money and connections anyways. ""It's only a *bachelor's degree,* you could always transfer in to MIT as your master's degree.""

Now, I'm struggling coming to terms with the fact that I'm not as special as I thought I was. It's like two halves of my body arguing all the time, one saying ""The system failed you. You are a diamond in the rough, they'll be sorry they rejected you. I'm unseen. I'm unloved. Woe is me"" and the other saying ""You're not special. Grow up and stop wallowing in self-pity and arrogance. Be happy of other people's achievements instead of despising them for it. You got rejected by IVY COLLEGES, it's FINE."" It doesn't help that every time my mom talks with my younger brother, who's in the process of college stuff, she says things like ""the college system is broken, it's all a matter of luck anyways"", giving me a sympathetic look which only serves to inflate my fragile ego. Then I see everyone on reddit and on the Internet who HAVE been accepted and recognized for their achievements, and it tears my ego back down.

tl;dr, grew up thinking i was the smartest, then quickly shown i in fact wasn't when rejected by all colleges and being exposed to smarter people. now i'm Gollum: simultaneously thinking i'm an unnoticed genius and thinking i'm spoiled and arrogant

808,aibmii,False,None,110,A brief analysis of 2374 college emails,ApplyingToCollege,"I had way too much time this weekend, so I decided to go into one of my email inboxes and do a sort of analysis on every email sent to me by colleges. 

A few disclaimers:

- I have two email addresses and have, in the past, used both as my CollegeBoard/ACT email. I decided to use the one that is currently associated with my CB/ACT accounts.
- I believe I have never deleted a college email or unsubscribed from a college's emails, though I'm not completely sure about this.
- Some of the numbers may be slightly inflated due to the way I counted them (described below)
- Certain colleges, like Xavier, sent me a fuckton of emails to my other email address and sent none at all to the one I counted, so this likely will not fully reflect your experience with certain colleges. If you guys want, I could do the same thing with my other email address if I have the time.

Before we start, here's how I counted:

- First, I would pull up all emails with that college's name in either the subject line or the sender name.
- Then, I counted every email I found that was actually from that college (so I wouldn't count emails I sent to them or emails from my school about them)
- Then, I subtracted every email that I requested, so things like questions that I asked, visit reminders, application updates, etc. wouldn't be counted. 
- Finally I put that number under ""unsolicited emails"" in a spreadsheet.

Because of the way this worked (and also the fact that sometimes my email client didn't respond when I clicked the down arrow) there may be a bit of deviation from the actual number, but that deviation should be relatively small.

Additionally, it's not possible in my email client to filter emails by whether or not they came from a .edu address, so the way I ended up with my final list of what was or wasn't a college email was simply from me looking up ""college"" or ""university"" in the search bar and writing down every name I came across. However this excluded a few colleges (notably Yale, MIT, Caltech, Notre Dame, and Rice) which I had to look for after the fact.  Additionally, some colleges sent me emails under different names (like ""Princeton University"" vs. ""Princeton Office of Admissions"") and so I may have not fully counted every single email from every single college on the list, but again, it would have been difficult for me to determine when that happened. As a result, the total number of emails I received is probably higher than 2374.

Just one last note: who the fuck named Pennsylvania's university systems? There are two public university systems in Pennsylvania, the Commonwealth System of Higher Education and the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education. But for some reason, Penn State is in the Commonwealth System and not the *Pennsylvania State* System. To make matters worse, the Pennsylvania State system had the brilliant idea of naming each of their campuses ""[city] University of Pennsylvania"", and even worse, some genius decided to put two of the campuses in cities named ""California"" and ""Indiana"". So now you have universities with names like ""California University of Pennsylvania"" and ""Indiana University of Pennsylvania"" which just makes it hard to search for ""University of California"", ""Indiana University"", and ""University of Pennsylvania"". /rant

Anyway, with all that out of the way, here's what I found:

***

# General stats:

**Overview:**

- **115** colleges sent me emails overall
- The total number of emails I received was **2374**.
 - The number of unsolicited* emails I received was **2175**.
- Out of all of these colleges, the average number of unsolicited emails sent was **18.9**.
- **17** colleges either sent me a custom application or a deadline extension. I didn't apply to any of them.

^(*Note: For the rest of this post, I'll only be referring to unsolicited emails unless I specifically state otherwise.)

**Top 10 spammers**

The top 10 schools that sent the most emails were:

- 1: [Louisiana State University was *by far* the highest, at **102**](https://i.imgur.com/Sta48zt.png)
- 2: Loyola Marymount University at **68**
- 3: The University of Iowa at **57**
- 4: Case Western Reserve University at **55**
- 5: Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Tulane University at **44**
- 7: Harvard College at **43**
- 8: Ohio University at **41**
- 9: Columbia University\*, Duquesne University, and Hofstra University at **40**

^(*For Columbia, I included all the special programs that they sent out, including their dual degree programs with Trinity College Dublin and Sciences Po. If you exclude those, the number of emails they sent goes down to 25. Also note that there was a three-way tie for ninth so I included 11 colleges.)

**T20s**

The number of emails that each top-20 university sent was:

- Princeton: **10**
- Harvard: **43**
- Columbia\*: **40** or **25**
- MIT: **13**
- UChicago: **25**
- Yale: **7**
- Stanford: **3**
- Duke: **28**
- UPenn: **11**
- JHU: **8**
- Northwestern: **13**
- Caltech: **17**
- Dartmouth: **8**
- Brown: **18**
- Vanderbilt: 9
- Cornell: **0**
- Rice: **22**
- Notre Dame: **32**
- UCLA: **0**
- WUSTL: **25**

^(*As was the case in the previous list, Columbia sent me 40 or 25, depending on whether or not you count their dual degree programs.)

Interestingly, Harvard sent the most out of all the top-20s and all the Ivies, despite being the most well-known. However a large proportion of the emails they sent were specifically about financial aid and student life, so I would guess that this is less of an effort to get their name out there and more to try and make it look more accessible.

**My applications**

The average number of emails for colleges I applied to was only **9.7**, though that includes colleges that didn't send me any emails at all. If you exclude colleges that didn't send any emails to me, then it goes up to **14.5**, still lower than the average of all the colleges that sent me emails. (As a reminder, the average number of emails sent for all colleges that sent me mail was **18.9**.)

***

#Extra things colleges sent me

**Custom applications**

**15** colleges/universities sent me custom applications (I limited these to those schools that send custom applications and then pretend they're something special like ""oh you've been selected to apply with our \*special\* application"", not the ones that have custom applications open to everyone like MIT or ASU.) They were:

- Bridgewater College: **""Bridgewater Choice Application""**
- Hampden-Sydney College: **""Gold Crest Application""**
- Hofstra University: **""Select Candidate Application""**
- IE University: **""Apex Candidate Application""**
- Indiana University of Pennsylvania: **""IUP Profile""**
- Knox College: **""Knox College Application""**
- Lawrence University: **""Lawrence Application""**
- Mary Baldwin University: **""Leader's Choice Application""**
- Montana State University: **""Leader's Edge Application""**
- Mount St. Mary's University: **""Pinnacle Application""**
- Radford University: **""Radford Choice Application""**
- Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute: **""Candidate's Choice Application""**
- Stevens Institute of Technology: **""Custom Application""**
- University of Denver: **""Pioneer Application""**
- University of Kentucky: **""Wildcat Application""**

Not surprisingly, many of these colleges sent more than the rest. The average number of emails for colleges that sent me a custom application was **31.5**. Again, the average out of all the colleges that sent me emails was **18.9** for comparison.

**Deadline extensions**

**12** colleges sent me application deadline extensions. They were:

- Bridgewater College
- Hampden-Sydney College
- Lawrence University
- Mary Baldwin University
- Montana State University
- Mount St. Mary's University
- Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
- Stevens Institute of Technology
- University of Denver
- University of Kentucky
- Babson College
- Olin College

Again unsurprisingly, with the exceptions of Babson and Olin, all of the colleges on this list were also in the ""custom application"" list. As you may have expected, these colleges had a high average number of emails sent, at **33.8**.

***

#Subject Lines:

**""Is this you?""**

Nine colleges sent me emails with subjects along the lines of ""Is this you?"" or ""Am I reaching [my name]"" or ""Is this your email address?"". They were:

- Bridgewater College: **""Is this your email address?""**
- Case Western Reserve University: **""Am I reaching [my name]?""**
- Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University: **""[my name], is this your preferred email address?""**
- IE University: **""Is this your current email, [my name]?""**
- Mary Baldwin University: **""Is this [my name]?""**
- Montana State University: **""Is this [my name]?""**
- Mount St. Mary's University: **""Is this still your e-mail address, [my name]?""**
- Radford University: **""Am I reaching [my name]?""**
- Stevens Institute of Technology: **""Is this priority candidate [my name]?""**
- University of Denver: **""Is this your email?""**

Given all the familiar faces here, you won't be surprised to learn that these colleges again sent far more emails (**38.0**) than most of the rest of the schools.

**""URGENT! APPLY ASAP!""**

**6** colleges also sent me emails with the word ""urgent"" in the subject line, and again we see the same group:

- Bridgewater College
- IE University
- Hofstra University
- Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
- West Virginia Wesleyan College
- Mount St. Mary's University. 

With the exception of West Virginia Wesleyan College, each of these universities also sent me a custom application.

**""yOu'Re ThE cHOseN oNe!""**

**4** colleges sent me emails with the phrase ""You've been selected"" or ""You've been chosen"", and for a third time we see the same culprits:

- IE University
- Montana State University
- University of Denver
- University of Kentucky

Again, each of these universities sent me a custom application.

***

#Extras:

Some extra little things I found while looking through all these emails:

- The University of Iowa sent me the exact same email three times in the same day, twice. I emailed them to let them know. I haven't received a response, but it hasn't happened since.
- Butler University used **21** emojis total in their subject lines.
- Lafayette College used the phrase ""Cur Non"" in **45%** of their subject lines and **75%** of their message bodies.
- The University of Mary Washington sent me ""Black Friday"" and ""Cyber Week"" deals. They were fee waivers.
- LSU was actually originally at **101**, but in the time that it took to write this post they sent me another email, bringing them up to **102**.


***

So yeah, I spent WAY too long on this post but here it is, I thought you guys would like it given how much we all hate college emails. 

It was pretty fun doing all this though, and I could probably extend this sometime in the future now that second senior semester is about to roll around. I can already think of a few possibilities:

- Include my second email address (which will include emails from colleges like Xavier, Swarthmore, and Bard's College at Simon's Rock who sent me a lot of stuff, just to a different address
- Do some kind of statistical analysis to see if there's a correlation between acceptance rate and number of emails, or college rank and number of emails
- Maybe (if I get REALLY bored) write a basic AI to mimic/imitate the language used in college emails

So yeah, thanks if you actually read the whole thing. If there's any specific information you want, like how many emails a specific college sent me or something, just let me know in the comments.

What secret service agent would call a random high schooler and tell them they’re “secret service”. After a brief conversation, I realized she wasn’t kidding. I was supposed to interview with a Penn alumnus who worked in the White House, but she wouldn’t say who. She offered to send me a car the next afternoon to bring me to the White House. After a multitude of security checks, I was led into a room. It was a weird room because it was oval-shaped. A minute later, guess who enters the room. The man himself.

811,flb31b,False,Serious,82,Why Inspect Element Can't Reveal Your College Decision,ApplyingToCollege,"Hi everyone!

Inspect element is a tool used to analyze the code of the front-end, or interface, of a website. However, a portal is **dynamic**, so it is updated with new information, such as an admission decision.

This updating of new information happens because in a dynamic webpage, the front-end code is controlled by a back-end system usually consisting of a server and databank. This is where your admission decision most likely is, and it will only show on the front-end code at a time specified by the back-end code. 

Since inspect element only analyzes front-end code, it cannot see the decision until it appears on the interface you see. It cannot look into back-end databanks, the two codes are not connected in such a way. 

Before you ask, no, you cant really hack into back-end code through the front-end code. They're not that seamlessly connected to eachother unless you have a gaping security issue (most universities will not)

If you’re smart and dedicated enough to reasonably apply to these schools, statistics show that those qualities will carry over to your college and future career regardless of your school choice.

What does all of this mean? It means that if you apply to the ivies/T20s, your intelligence and drive is reasonably likely to lead you to just as fulfilling and successful of a career as an ivy grad. So, if you’re smart and driven enough to apply, then your college career is expected to pan out amazingly. Don’t worry about it!

Hey everyone! Last week I posted on here asking for you guys to fill out a survey of pretty much everything about you guys -- colleges applied to and results, demographics, stats, etc. Well, after 15 hours of going through all the data, I'm proud to present the r/A2C Class of 2023 Profile.

Some quick stats for you guys:

- There were 605 individual applicants who applied to a combined 397 colleges (amounting to 5,224 individual applications). 44 states and 32 countries are represented (Nevada, Alaska, Hawaii, Wyoming, Idaho, and Mississippi people wya?).

- From those applications, 2,732 of them were accepted, 1,724 rejected, and 711 waitlisted.

- A whopping 27.5% of us are from California; the next two states with the most representation are New York with 7.5% and Massachusetts with 5.6%.

- Our overall acceptance rate was 52.3%, 21.3% of deferred applications were accepted, and our T20 acceptance rate was 23.4%.

- There was a total of 770 different pieces of advice submitted to aid the current juniors and future classes.

- The most popular colleges to apply to were UCLA (169), UC Berkeley (162), and Stanford (145). Similarly, the most matriculated to universities were Undecided (109), UC Berkeley (32), and Stanford (19).


[The infographic I made is a bit more in-depth \(and prettier\), so be sure to check that out here.

There was no way I could go through all the advice on my own, so after cleaning it of toxicity, I put them all in a Google Sheets document. Let me know if there's any left as I probably skipped one or two. **The advice here is AMAZING. Juniors, take a look or bookmark the page to read later.** Each question is on a different sheet; change them by clicking which sheet you'd like to go to at the bottom of the page.

**Disclaimer**: I started compiling data regarding college results at around the 550 response mark, and started doing the rest of the data at 605. Also, I didn't get the answer for matriculation for the first 50 or so responses. So, bear in mind that this data is a bit of a Frankenstein. However, it *does* give good insight to who r/a2c actually is.

831,h7ycg6,False,Serious,76,Please Note The Difference Between “Test-Optional” and “Test-Blind”!,ApplyingToCollege,"Just wanted to remind you guys that there is a difference between schools going test-optional and test-blind, and I wanted to explain why (in my opinion) admissions at test-optional schools are probably not getting easier or more random!

Test-blind means that even if you have SAT/ACT/SAT subject test score(s), the school will not consider it when evaluating your application. Examples of schools adopting this policy are Caltech (for the next 2 admissions cycles, they will not look at SAT/ACT scores) and MIT (they won’t look at SAT subject tests moving forward, you can’t even submit them). 

Test-optional means that an SAT/ACT score in your application is not required to be considered for admission to a certain school. Many colleges in recent months have gone test-optional in response to COVID-19 and are saying it’s because they want to “help students out” given that many test dates were cancelled. The thing, though, is that they’re doing it because they don’t want their application numbers to go down. If they make SAT/ACT tests required, they’re going to be blocking off a (potentially) huge chunk of their normal application pool. This means that they’ll have to accept a larger percentage of the students who apply, and that will reflect as a higher acceptance rate. Colleges don’t want that! 

So: just because a college is test-optional doesn’t mean you shouldn’t submit competitive SAT/ACT scores! If you have a good score, submit it for consideration because AOs would like to see it and it will definitely help you out! 

If you’re only applying to test-blind schools, then you can truly rest assured that you don’t need to try taking the SAT/ACT, or if you don’t have the best score, you won’t be put at a disadvantage. But for those applying to test-optional schools (especially the selective ones like Yale, JHU, uPenn), try your best to take it and still get a good score, because there are undoubtedly people in the application pool who took the SAT/ACT way early on and got it knocked out of the way, and that early preparation (hypothetically, if all things were equal) is going to give them an advantage in the admissions process.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/h7ycg6/please_note_the_difference_between_testoptional/,1010,"I have a question; I am a rising senior and I am trying to understand the importance of Subject SAT tests this upcoming fall.

833,en4zk5,False,None,61,I let it ruin my life. Don’t make the same mistake.,ApplyingToCollege,"Someone posted several days ago about how obsessing over college, grades, and extracurriculars ruined their life. I want to share my story.

I developed an adderall addiction early on in my high school career. When I was a freshman, I went on Reddit for study tips and I learned about the “wonderful” effects of adderall. At my school, there are a lot of study drug dealers (uber competitive school) so I squandered a lot of money for just adderall. Now, as a senior, I have an adderall addiction  all because I wanted better grades and a perfect GPA.

I also started taking caffeine pills to stay awake and melatonin to help me sleep on the weekends to make up for the lost sleep time. Imagine how taxing this is to your body. One day, while studying for my chem exam, I took adderall *and* a caffeine pill at the same time and I thought I was gonna have a heart attack. I have never been more scared in my life.

I’ve cried because I got a 35 on my ACT. I spent 90-something dollars in order to raise my score by a mere fucking point. All for what? An added marginal chance of 2.5% of getting into an Ivy League college? 

I’ve also become extremely judgmental about everyone around me. All I care about are grades and academic stats. Because of this, I have absolutely no fucking close friends at all. Being a good person with average grades is so much better than being an asshole with top-tier grades. Don’t be that asshole.

I did all of this because for my whole life I wanted to be a doctor. I finally broke down in my band director’s office today because I realized that being a doctor wasn’t my dream, I was only imagining that it was my dream because of the salary and my parents’ wishes. My whole life I planned to be a doctor, and now, way into senior year, I realized that I have no path other than to become a doctor. I’m stuck in the middle of nowhere and it’s practically too late for me.

To those of you underclassmen, *please.* It’s not worth it. I’ve severely impacted my mental and physical health and social life because I thought grades were the be-all-end-all. I wholeheartedly regret not doing the things I would have loved to do, like practice the piano more or make friends and go hiking with them or explore new hobbies instead of studying all the time. 

Don’t let it ruin your life. Please.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/en4zk5/i_let_it_ruin_my_life_dont_make_the_same_mistake/,1005,We’re all addicts bud ,2020-01-11 08:30:47

In a few weeks we're going to start seeing the posts.  ""Does the deadline of November 1st mean midnight or 12:59:59? What time zone is that deadline?""  I know, I'm a procrastinator too.  You're going to want to squeeze out every second possible before submitting those applications. (and it usually means 11:59:59 in the time zone where the college is located)

Do yourself a favor and pretend the deadline is a day or two earlier though.  You may have less time than you think.

It didn't happen last year, but in the past the Common App has been swamped on deadline day and had outages and severe lag.  Some people say there were DDOS attacks two years ago, but it's hard to distinguish between DDOS attacks and a company just not having a robust enough server to handle additional load.  Be that as it may, this forum was filled with anguish as people watched their chance to submit an application in the early round slip away with 'unable to connect' and the spinning hourglass/rainbow circle.

Even if the Common App manages to handle the load, there are local outages that can hit you.  Transformers blow.  This time of year we can have windstorms and in the north we can get early snow.  Internet access dies at random for someone every year.

Don't let that happen to you.  Pretend that the deadline is October 30.

844,bgkuik,False,None,179,Can I just give out an advice to all Americans who are planning to apply to college soon to give British schools (or overseas schools) a look. Especially if you are middle class.,ApplyingToCollege,"I’m an American, went to a top American high school, watched all my friends get into top American colleges, and I decided to go to London to study at one of the best schools. 

I was also trapped in that middle class problem. Too rich to quality for financial aid, too poor to afford college. 

Well British schools are significantly cheaper. Tuition is around 25k usd a year. And then you can choose where to live. No on site residence requirements. Also most degrees are three years long. And did I mention drinking age there is 18? And you get to experience another culture. 

Look into Oxbridge, UCL, KCL, LSE, and other top colleges. I guarantee you will love it as I have!!

My college counselors at my American school didn’t even tell me about British colleges, so I wish I had applied to more British schools in hindsight, but I’m so glad I came here. I just wanted to share that UK might be an option for you!!

EDIT: a lot of people here are saying that I’m being misleading by saying that tuition is cheaper. I only say that it is cheaper than the US if you don’t qualify for financial aid in the us and you want to go to a private school AND you want to still go to a prestigious school. For example, if you were to choose between Harvard full price vs Oxbridge full price (they are same level), Oxbridge will be much cheaper. For me, I chose between paying 65k USD a year for four years for mediocre American colleges vs. choosing to pay 40k USD a year for a top global university that carries a name.

Also can I just say that unfortunately there aren’t that many scholarship options for American students and I really recommend familiarizing yourself with the system as unfortunately, American college counselors have almost no clue as to how to navigate the UK system.  

Also for everyone telling me I’m giving out a bad advice because I say it is cheaper, well first of all, I’m not giving a bad advice. And all I’m saying is to take a look into it, familiarize yourselves, and perhaps something will change your mind. E.g. some British schools have now opened up common app so you don’t even have to apply UCAS. Also if you want to do medicine or law, you can apply straight into these degrees even though it may be hard to practice them in the USA once you get there degrees. Still something to THINK about. Please don’t roast me thx

EDIT again: https://www.studyacrossthepond.com/ is a helpful organization from what I have heard. I did not use them, but I have heard things.

EDIT again again: Clearly, I've rubbed some people the wrong way here. Sorry but I can't change the title and I am sorry if my understanding of middle class is different from yours. And sorry if the finance bit is triggering. Of course it depends on everyone's individual circumstances. For me, I did not do a STEM subject. My fee per year was 18,000 GBP when I started, which is a bit less than 25,000 USD today. I also managed to keep my yearly cost to 10,000 GBP, so all in all, I paid 40,000 USD for THREE years for tuition, room, and board. Considering how some schools are 60-70,000 USD for FOUR years, this was a very good option for me. And as other redditors have suggested here, if the UK is too expensive, check out other schools in Canada, Netherlands, etc!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bgkuik/can_i_just_give_out_an_advice_to_all_americans/,989,UK is a big risk tho.

It doesn’t matter if you have a 36 ACT and a perfect GPA. It doesn’t matter if you cured cancer and fed the homeless by hand for eleven years straight. It doesn’t matter if your parents are billionaires and your hamster has his own diamond studded Tesla. You are guaranteed NOTHING in the college admissions process.

I see so many people on this sub reeling after getting their decisions back because their “safety schools” were schools like Vanderbilt and Rice.

6. you get my drift?
7. don't be afraid to start over; you might like the sentence you just wrote but stop trying to shove into your essays where it doesn't fit
8. whatever you do, don't try to edit while writing. you'll get stuck on one paragraph and you'll never move on (trust me. i spent 5 hours trying to write one paragraph)
9. on a related note, don't be afraid to skip around. if you REALLY can't word something perfectly now, make a note (i like to use \[insert \_\_\_\_ here\]) and keep going. don't let it slow you down
10. if you're finally satisfied, congrats! come back to it in a day and reconsider. edit. start over if necessary. rinse and repeat.
11. balance college apps with school. don't check the time and realize it's almost midnight and you haven't started your homework
12. take everything on this subreddit with a grain of salt. it has good advice, but don't let it control you
13. take a break. walk around the house, talk to your parents, play with your pet, or switch gears. it'll clear your head and help the ideas flow better the next time you sit down to write
14. eat a snack and blame the stress
15. i like listening to white noise while i work. or lo-fi. but anything with lyrics or anything i even vaguely know the tune to? absolutely not. turn off anything that might distract you.

please add on! a lot of these have been reiterated on this sub thousands of times, but these are the things i came to realize while writing my common app essay. i am the worst at writing essays bc concentrating isn't my strong suit and i'm an obsessed perfectionist, but some of these really helped!

#Part 7:  How To End An Essay Gracefully

Ending essays is hard, and most students struggle to end their essay elegantly.  Mistakes here can linger in the reviewer's mind and really bring down what might have otherwise been a strong essay.  They often seem to end:

**1.  Abruptly as if the word count snuck up on them** and tackled them from behind just as they were drawing a breath to continue.  Sometimes this is actually what happened and the student didn't edit very well (if this is you, see Part 5 linked above).  

**2.  By simply rehashing something that was already stated** – a casualty of the common yet misguided advice to make your point thrice over in your introduction, body, and conclusion.  Other times students turn to their academic BSing skills and just say the same things a slightly different way to fill out the word count.  If this sounds familiar, see Part 6 linked above.

**3.  With a trite aphorism or sweeping generality.**  Examples include phrases such as ""striving to achieve our full potential,"" ""making the world a better place,"" etc.  These are commonplace and lame, but worse, they say nothing about the student.  Instead, they make the AO instantly aware that the author is trying to make an impression with such a statement and it causes skepticism about the sincerity of everything they just read.  

#So how do you end an essay in a compelling and purposeful way?

Obviously you want to give the sense that the essay actually ended intentionally rather than being stifled by the word count or trailing off into awkward silence.  You also want to leave a final good impression.  You need to close gracefully, sincerely, and purposefully so they continue to feel positively about you and reward you with a top score.  Here are a few ideas - there are more in the full guide available on my site.  I'd love to hear any others you have in the comments.

#The Comedian's Call Back

I'm fond of the ""call back"" commonly used by comedians (see:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_(comedy)). You reference something from earlier in your essay to say one more thing about yourself. Sometimes this is something that you used to start the essay off. Other times it's something that was a major theme of the essay, a big part of the story you told, or a salient insight or twist on something you mentioned before.   

#The Interchapter

Another option is to depart from the story and inject something more about you. Examples of this in literature include the socialist meeting Jurgis stumbles upon at the end of Upton Sinclair's The Jungle and John Galt's speech at the end of Atlas Shrugged.  You obviously don't have the space to elaborate here, so one or two sentences is probably enough.  You will want to work in a smooth transition though so it doesn't feel jilted or like it ""breaks the fourth wall.""  One example of a good way to do this is to end with a quote about you spoken by one of the characters in your story.

However you choose to end, try to show depth of thought, introspection, maturity, and humility.  Just like great stories, when you do this right, the AO finishes the essay wishing it had continued longer.  They want to know more about you and are intrigued by the personality you presented.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/c6mckh/how_to_end_an_essay_gracefully/,972,!remindme 330 days ,2019-06-28 16:34:19

I have been attending reunions, football and soccer games, and other events on campus since before I can remember. I even met Elon Musk, one of my idols, there. I’ve been wearing Stanford sweatshirts since 4th grade and my house is littered with Stanford shit. At a very young age, I made it my goal to attend the school, and as I grew up, I fell deeper in love with it and envisioned my life there. Stanford was my dream school in every sense of the word. 

Yesterday, I was rejected. Obviously, I didn’t expect to get in, but the rejection was initially painful nonetheless.

As time passed and I gained distance from the news, a few things crossed my mind. Anyone who has or will face a college rejection should consider these things:
- As we travel through life, we find ourselves facing forks in the road at important moments. One of these roads was just blocked. I have little doubt that the path we find ourselves on will be more beautiful than we ever could’ve imagined, and that we will be incredibly grateful for the rejection in the long run.
- We know our accomplishments. We know how hard we’ve worked. We know how good of a friend we are, the joy and laughter we bring to others, the contributions we make in and out of the classroom. Don’t let a college be the source of your validation. Recognize the things that make you awesome, and understand that the amazing people in your life are a reflection of who you are. 
- Just because we didn’t get in doesn’t mean we aren’t smart or accomplished enough to do well there or that we aren’t smarter or harder working than the people who go there. Considering the other people from my school who got in, I know that for a fact lol.
- FIDO: Fuck it and drive on.

875,8t4cee,False,None,82,The Top 30 Mistakes You Need To Avoid In Your Essay,ApplyingToCollege,"I've seen many people ask for a list of common essay mistakes so they know what not to do.  Here's a fairly comprehensive list I've compiled based on my experience, discussions with others in admissions, and books I've read.  You would think that many of these would be self-evident or obvious, but experience indicates otherwise.  Feel free to add others or ask questions in the comments.

1.  **Don't choose a common topic.**  It's possible to write a good essay in this space but *so much more difficult* because of the sheer volume that comes in.  This includes the standard sports injury/championship, mission trip, death of a grandparent, and slightly meta ""getting into this college would be the culmination of my dreams"" essays.  To a lesser degree, this also includes ""soup du jour"" essay topics like cryptocurrency, social media, or whatever else is trending.  Yes, it is theoretically possible to have a good essay on any of these topics.  But every AO rolls their eyes and dies a little inside every time they have to read *another* one.

**2.  Make sure you write about something that is actually important to you.**  Full meta essays about college applications/grades/tests feel like they are clever and creative, but they aren't that distinctive or original.  And there's no way the college application process is *that big* of a part of who you are because you've only been doing it for ~7 months tops.  People who write about this are basically climbing on the /r/iamverysmart horse and riding it all the way to /r/im14andthisisdeep town.  Other people write about things they think AOs *want* them to write about.  What they actually want you to write about is YOU.

**3.  Don't write about super polarizing or sensitive issues.**  Don’t be dogmatic, political, religious, cult-like, overly dramatic, aggressive, racist, sexist, or argumentative.  Often you come across as somewhat crass or blunt simply because you don't have the space to explain your complex views fully enough and the topic is so delicate.  Other times your opinions clash with the deeply held views of whoever is reading your essays.  Again, it's possible to write good essays on delicate topics, but it's risky - just like killing a fly in your grandmother's house with a baseball bat.  (e.g. one student got into Stanford with a 100 word supplement on what was important to him that was just ""Black Lives Matter"" 33 times. But that's super risky and could have backfired badly.)  

**4.  Don't curse too much,** try too hard to incite pity or catharsis, be overly pessimistic / self-deprecating, talk about your forays into illegal/unethical activities, or do anything else dark, depressing, or weird.  You want to stand out as unique, but not like this.

**5.  Avoid using too many big words.**  Do not, repeat, *DO NOT* touch that thesaurus.  You want this essay to be **your voice**.  You're smart and you want the AO to know that, but they will already see your SAT verbal score and your transcript, so you don't need to hit them in the face with a thesaurus. Using too many big words sounds unnatural and makes it sound like you're trying to be impressive rather than expressive. Instead of coming away with ""wow this guy is really passionate and a creative problem solver"" they might just find you insincere, boring, and uninspiring. Big words in excess drain emotion and jar the reader out of the story and remind them that they're sitting in a windowless room evaluating essays. They are WAY overused in these essays too, and often evoke a ""here we go again"" sigh.  You can sound full of yourself and arrogant too.  Remember that you want to be likeable, personable, and charismatic.  These will be more impressive to an AO than people who try too hard to impress with intellect and vocabulary.

**6.  Take time to edit & review your essays.**  I've seen essays list the wrong school.  I've seen a student literally misspell her own first name in the essay.  I've seen essays that scream that English is not your first language so loudly they are hard to get through.  You don't want any of those.  Review your essays, revise them, and get someone else to help give you feedback too.  [Here's a post with some tips for reviewing your essays](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/75lhsa/some_tips_for_reviewing_your_application/)

**7.  Don't make your essays low effort or last minute rush jobs.**  Too many bright students are used to churning out an essay in a couple hours and getting an A almost by default.  Or they're used to putting things off until the last minute but succeeding anyway because they're very bright.  Or maybe they're shotgunning too many schools and are already sick of it.  Or maybe they don't actually want to go to that particular school so they don't really try.  Whatever the reason, this is a recipe for disaster on college application essays because they are supposed to be much more than the typical writing you produce.  They should be thoughtful, introspective, expressive, creative, inspiring, interesting, and revealing.  You won't get that kind of compelling writing in a single draft or with a lazy approach.  Usually, when an essay was thrown together with little effort or very quickly, it shows.  That always communicates that you either don't care enough to give it the time and effort it deserves, or that you aren't capable of better.  Either way it's a fast one-way ticket to the waitlist.

**8.  Don't try to write about your entire life from a 30,000 foot view.**  You simply don't have space to say everything about yourself, so don't try.  Pick a few attributes and try to tell one story that showcases those.  If you bite off more than you can chew, you probably won't end up saying anything really compelling about yourself.  The more you zoom out, the more every student looks the same.  It's only when you talk to them, get to know them, spend time with them, learn about them, and engage them that you start to see how different, vibrant, interesting, talented, and incredible they are.  So give the AO an opportunity to get close to you in the essay.  Go small.  Zoom in on one story, not your whole life.  Don't use an introduction, just jump right in and let the story fill in the details as you go.

**9.  Don't use pithy aphorisms, clichés, or generalities even if ~~you made them up~~ they're original to you.**  Don't try to include wholesome sounding life lessons or broad sweeping statements about the world or humanity.  None of these:  ""I learned more from them than they did from me.""  ""By striving to achieve greatness we can become more than we ever thought possible.""  ""Only by helping others can a person truly realize their potential in the world.""  ""I am far stronger than I knew and I'm excited to face the next set of challenges.""  Those are all the worst and are an instant eye-roll and ""not this again"" sigh.

**10.  Don't fail to complete a portion of the application.**  On multiple occasions I have been reviewing an app and the next section loads and it's empty.  I refresh the page and still get nothing.  I reach out to the admins to make sure there's not a clerical or systems error.  Then I ask them to check the student record and if possible follow up with the student to make sure they completed the section.  Sometimes we get a response with the missing section and sometimes we don't.  It's never turned out well.  Many schools would not be this gracious and would simply move on to the next app.  If you're paying the app fee, get your money's worth by actually filling out the whole thing.

**11.  Don't be so academic and stick so close to the prompt.**  Some prompts are easier to fall into this mistake than others, but so often students are conditioned to answer the questions directly and fully like they would for school.  The prompt is primarily there to get you to talk about yourself.  So if it asks why you want to go to X school, don't write 500 words praising the school for being so awesome.  They already know how awesome they are.  What they want to know about is YOU and how YOU fit the school.  Make sure your response addresses the prompt and that it's clearly written for that school, but don't treat it like an exam question.  Think of it more like someone asked you that question on a date to find out more about you.  

**12.  Don't steal an essay that isn't yours.**  Sometimes this works and you take credit for a well-written and proven essay.  But there is also the risk that you could get caught and there is no statute of limitations on this.  If they discover it 25 years after you graduate, they can still cancel your degree.  It's just not worth the risk.  Not only is it riskier than most students realize, it's also not as effective.  What was a powerful and compelling picture of one student might not work or fit for you.  Holistic review means that everything is considered together in evaluating applications.  When things don't fit, it raises a variety of concerns and the total picture of the applicant just isn't as strong.

**13.  Avoid overused words, especially SAT words - plethora, myriad, ameliorate, etc.**  These don't make you sound smart.  They make you sound fake and basic.  Use words that you would use to talk about yourself to a friend or on a date or in a job interview.  

**14.  Don't use a template from a book, or model your essay after someone else's.**  One of the admissions officers that contributed to The New Rules of College Admissions tells the story of how one year she and her colleagues read several dozen essays that all talked about a genie granting wishes and how the wishes embodied the student and his/her ambitions for college and life.  They scratched their heads over the striking similarities until one of them found a book published that year that had a successful essay example that was the genie essay.  This didn't end well for those students. 

**15.  Don't go over the word limit.** AO's have to read a ton of essays and if yours is demonstrably longer, it's going to be annoying at best and detrimental to your rating at worst.  Many application review systems will automatically truncate responses at the word limit, so the end may not even show up.  

**16.  At the same time, don't write an essay that is less than about 60% of the word limit.**  Unless you have a really clever, amazing, and heretofore unseen idea that requires this, you should aim for 80-100% of the word limit.  If you're less than 60%, it just looks lazy, uninspired, aloof, and disengaged.  

**17.  Avoid giving off bad vibes.**  This includes excessive bragging, self-absorption, entitlement, snootiness, arrogance, bravado, presenting an abrasive personality, or anything else that indicates you will struggle to fit in to a vibrant community and flourishing student body.  Most of the major problems colleges deal with are related to a very small minority of their students.  So it saves a lot of big headaches to screen these people out in the admissions process.  Make sure your essay says ""plays well with others"" and not ""social pariah bound for arrest or expulsion.""  You want to come across as interesting, likeable, fun, clever, creative, and upbeat.  Let your SAT and grades showcase how smart you are.

**18.  Avoid pitymongering**, humblebragging, being a victim, depressed rants, passive aggressive or reverse psychology attempts  (e.g. ""I just know I'm going to be rejected""), self-deprecation that goes too far, or generally an overly negative attitude.  This should be a showcase of your strengths, the very best you on your very best day.  Avoid putting others down, diving deep into personal conflicts (one essay I read was about a student's best friend abandoning her and how she cut her out of her life), showing inability to work with others and airs of superiority, paranoid defensiveness, or general toxicity.

**19.  Don't go overboard with BS or exaggeration.**  AOs are pretty familiar with common accomplishments and what typical high achieving students look like, so don't try too hard to stretch things.  They're also pretty familiar with BS because so many students try to pass it off as legitimate in their applications.  

**20.  Don't use the essay to explain the reason you don't have a 4.0**.  Don't make excuses, blame others or society for your shortcomings/struggles, gripe about injustices in your life, etc.  The essay is a space for you to showcase your personality, skills, abilities, accomplishments, talents, strengths, and potential.   

**21.  Make sure every essay you write says something meaningful about YOU**.  So many well-written essays end up being less impactful because they fail to say anything about the student.  If you tell a story, make sure it shows something compelling and insightful about you.

**22.  Don't simply rehash all the other stuff in your application.**  Essays take a lot of time to review, and AOs do not appreciate redundancy.  If you do write about something already listed in your application, make sure it adds more information and shows more of your personality, character, ability, etc.

**23.  Don't discuss or complain about your mental illnesses or other limitations.**  If you want to address extenuating circumstances, you can do so in the additional information section or have one of your recommenders explain it on your behalf.  Note that even here you want the focus to be on how you've overcome challenges, grown through them, and what you've learned in the process.  The essay shouldn't be wasted just trying to get you back to par with ""normal"" applicants, instead it should show how you are unique, awesome, and desirable as you are.  

**24.  Don't try too hard**.  This includes overdone attempts to impress, to be unique, to write well, to sound smart, to be funny, to make light of something serious, etc.  It's a little hard to define exactly what constitutes trying too hard, but AOs know it when they see it.  When you aren't yourself and it's not your voice, it's always going to be a worse essay.  ""Go home and write a page tonight and let that page come out of you.  Then it will be true.""  - Langston Hughes.  I'm taking that quote out of context, but if you go read Theme For English B, you'll see exactly what I mean.

**25.  Don't recycle an essay that was clearly written for something else.**  This includes submitting an essay that was done for a class in school, making bad and obvious copy/paste errors, or shoehorning a different application essay in.  All of these result in an essay that just doesn't feel right.

**26.  Don't get cute with fonts, presentation, etc.**  This means no secret codes, wingdings, mirror writing, weird poetry, Elvish, Klingon, Morse code, or arranging the words to form a pattern or picture.  I have seen or heard of all of these and they never go well.  Write the essay in English unless it's an international or multilingual school in which case you should write in the language you would be using there.  Don't try to impress AOs with how well you know French.  AO's don't have time or patience for that – they'll just skip over it and move on.

**27.  Don't write illegibly or incoherently**.  Use proper grammar, syntax, and diction – but remember to use your own voice.  Do not cite sources or do anything too academic.  This is an essay about you, not a documented research paper.  But it still needs to be easy to read.  An AO with hundreds of essays to read will appreciate it.

**28.  Don't regurgitate the prompt in your introduction.**  I know your English teacher probably taught you to do this in a 5 paragraph theme paper, but this is a different thing entirely.  Keep your essay unique and interesting.  Don’t be bland, predictable, or too straightforward.  Don't answer the prompt like you would on a test in school.  Instead, tell a story about your life.

**29.  Don't put down or belittle the college.**  Some students do this because it's not their first choice, they legitimately feel like insulting the institution, they want to intimate that the college is somehow ""beneath them"", or someone is making them apply.  Whatever the reason, it will only make you look petty, negative, and self-absorbed.  If you give off the sentiment that you don’t want to attend that college, the AO will probably oblige you.

**30.  Don't tell a story or write an essay that doesn't have a point.**  Some essays seem aimless and just ramble until the word limit is fulfilled.  I think many students are used to doing this in school to BS their way through an essay assignment of a given length.  Others don’t know what they want to say in the first place and end up saying nothing.  Remember that the focus of the essay (regardless of the prompt) is to reveal yourself to the AO.  Get them to like you, be curious about you, and leave with a positive impression of you.

In elementary school you called me thick-headed and hopeless. And no, not out of friendly teasing as you insist today. You'd watch me in legitimate disgust. 

In middle school I worked my hardest to please you and my father and it resulted in OCD towards school assignments and grades. I strived to be the perfect student. As a result I because anxious and shut everyone out of my life. At which point i was no longer thick-headed but instead you called me anti-social, awfully nerdy, a loner, pestered me on my weight (i was a ""whopping"" 80 pounds just btw.. wtf even), my looks, how i dressed, and decided i was just outright strange. 

My self esteem plummeted and by high school my grades dropped (I know- great timing right). The stellar student in me became a shell of what i once was. Now to you I have been distracted and academically challenged. Whenever we'd drive around Seattle by one of my reach schools (in-state) you'd laugh and say ""Look, it's the school you'll never get into"". You insisted i'd have to attend community college. 

Today I got into that reach school we would drive by, University of Washington.

887,cfby8k,False,None,65,My advice to rising seniors,ApplyingToCollege,"After being on this sub for a while, I'm finally deciding to leave it, seeing as how I'll be off to college in a month and I want to stop comparing how I did in high school to everyone else on here. Before I go, however, I want to leave some advice to all of you who are going to be applying for colleges soon before.

1. Start your applications early. Don't procrastinate on them. That just makes for a lot of stress. 

2. Get your letter of recommendation early and MAKE SURE YOUR TEACHERS SUBMIT THEM TO THE COMMONAPP OR WHATEVER YOU'RE APPLYING ON. Nothing sucks more than knowing that your teacher wrote a great letter of recommendation for you, but they never submitted it. That happened to me while I was applying and I kept forgetting to talk to them.

3. Apply early to a school with rolling admission that you like, even if it's not your first choice. If you can get an acceptance early-on, then it will help calm down your stress as the year goes on. That way, if you dont get accepted to your top choice(s), you'll still have a school like you like that you can go to.

4. When deciding on a college, make sure you know what the dorms are like. Sometimes, the campus is great, but the dorms are awful. You're most likely going to be living in those for one to four years, so make sure you'd be comfortable.

5. JUST BECAUSE YOU GET MAIL FROM A SCHOOL DOES NOT GUARENTEE ACCEPTANCE. For example, I got mail from a lot of places, but out of the ones I applied to, I was accepted to a total of two schools (I'm not going to lie, though, I was aiming high).

6. Just because your scores are above average for some places does not mean you'll get in.

7. Just because you are a legacy amd worked hard does not mean you'll get in.

8. Be proud of the schools that you get into, no matter how high the acceptance rate is.

9. APPLY FOR SCHOLARSHIPS. ESPECIALLY OF YOU ARE IN THAT MIDDLE CLASS ZONE WHERE YOU CAN'T REALLY PAY FOR IT BUT YOU DON'T GET FEDERAL AID. Those scholarships can make a HUGE difference. Sit down and start applying. Stop procrastinating on that.

10. Pick a college because YOU like it and YOU want to go there. Don't let your parents, friends, teachers, or anyone else pick it for you. No matter how excited they are about it, you're going to be the one living there for 4 years. Even if it's some very prestigious university, if you're not happy there, what's the point? If you're going to be miserable all the time and hate what you're doing, what's the point in going there? Don't let anyone pick your school for you. After all, it's YOUR school.

11. Know that your rejections don't set your value as a person. Chances are, you're going to get some rejections and some acceptances. That's normal. Acceptances and rejections don't reflect who you are or your value as a person.

Now, I'm quickly going to say the obligatory ""I'm on mobile"" so that if the formatting is messed up, y'all know why. I hope that this helps you as you start the application process. Even if only 5 of you see this and take the time to read it, if it helps, then I'll consider it a success. Thanks for taking the time to read this, and good luck with your applications and college searches!

890,h8uqdu,False,Essays,114,"Literally, essays can be whatever you want them to be (but do avoid some topics)",ApplyingToCollege,"Here’s some examples of essays I’ve heard/read over the years...

- How doing speech and debate regained a my confidence after a decade of speech therapy (my own common app) 
- Collecting piggy banks 
- Getting your head stuck between Ronald McDonald’s legs at a McDonald’s play place 
- A ton about being/hosting a foreign exchange student and how small things like a church bell or a sandwich connects cultures 
- Making meatballs with an older family member 

You can literally write about anything and everything you want to write about. However, there’s topics you should steer clear of. For example, don’t write about how amazing and inspirational your uncle is. AOs will be like “that’s great your uncle is so wonderful but we don’t know anything about you.” 

Avoid sob stories but if you decide to do one, focus on how you grew based on it. I literally wrote a supplemental essay about getting my first B and how it made me realize that it’s okay to ask for help and it’s great to build a relationship with my teacher. Even some personal growth stories from tragedy can be overdone. For example, talking about a sick relative and how you want to be a doctor/nurse to take care of people like them. 

Don’t write about mission trips. We had an AO visit our school and this is literally the first thing she said. They all just end up reading the same of how “you can still be happy and have nothing.” Also don’t write about sports unless you’re on an athletic scholarship. Like mission trip essays, they all just kinda read the same.


Edit: Also, I know many people are starting to write essays. Hear are my only two tips for they A) have your program read your essay aloud for you. It’ll help you pick up an any grammar errors/awkward phases. B) If essay is too long, search for “that” in your paper. A lot of use “that” a ton while writing and 99% of the time it’s unnecessary.

893,89k25t,False,None,129,A Miracle Harvard Acceptance,ApplyingToCollege,"***This will take a little while to read. This post is not intended to be cruel, but rather to present a realistic picture of top-tier admissions to prospective undergraduates. To address the holier than thou tone that will undoubtedly be present in this post, I'll preface this by saying that I was rejected from two Ivy League schools (Harvard & UPenn), as well as UMich, Georgetown, and Tufts.*** 


Alright, enough about me. Let's get to you. Based on the demographics of this sub, I'll take a very rough guess that you are a 17 or 18-year-old middle-upper class white male. You have very competitive stats, hold multiple leadership roles in organizations at your school, wrote well thought out essays, and received glowing LORs. Most other kids from your hometown do not compare to you scholastically. In other words? You kicked ass in high school. It's your senior year, and you applied to a number of highly selective undergraduate schools. 

In light of recent ~~rejections~~ events, a growing number of posts have been made on this forum disparaging the inequities present within the college admissions process. Complaints about affirmative action far outnumber critiques of any other system. The implication is that race allows underqualified applicants to gain admission to elite institutions over more deserving, non-minority students. 

This is an extreme oversimplification and shows a fundamental lack of understanding of the admissions process. In an effort to remedy this, I'm taking you on a trip to Cambridge, Massachusetts.

*It's a cold January day here, and flurries are starting to sprinkle. I just finished a slice of cheese at Pinocchio's, a charming pizza place where Mark Zuckerburg used to do CS problem sets. Head outside and turn down Brattle Street, and you end up at the Office of Undergraduate Admissions for Harvard. Inside, your application is currently being considered along with two others for two spots in the incoming Freshman class.*

**Alright, sorry to break the immersion, but I feel the need to say that I understand that this is not close to how admissions decisions are actually made. But I feel that this hypothetical allows the whole picture to become more clear.**

*Where were we? Right. Three applicants. Two spots. Let's meet your peers.*

*Three kids. There's one female, URM. Dirt poor. Slightly lower stats than you. There's you, middle-class male, white. Then there's one ultra-rich white male. Legacy. Lowest stats of the bunch, but only because of a poor freshman year. Everyone has comparable ECs, strong essays, LORs, etc.*

*So (cue opening scene of ""The Social Network""); ""How do you distinguish yourself in a population of people who all got 1600s on their SATs?""*

*Simple. You need a differentiating factor. In your high school bubble, you were the best. To cut it here? You need to be the best of the best.*


*When those kids walk onto campus for orientation, they will be at one of the most selective institutions in the world. The students around them are all exceptional in different ways. The rich kid has a dad with a $50 million net worth. The URM chick got a perfect SAT score and a 4.0 from a one bedroom house smaller than your kitchen. Look to your left, there's Malia Obama. To your right, Yara Shahidi.*

***This is your competition.***

""Wait. These kids are special cases! What about the normal ones?""

*Harvard offered 1962 people a spot in the incoming freshman class this year. Now, you're right. Malia & Yara are celebrities. They are a special case. Still, let's say two more celebrities applied this year. That's two spots gone. 1960 left. Roughly 30% of the class will be legacy students. That's 589 more spots off the list. 1371 left. 200 more will go to athletes. 1171 left. 10 go to faculty kids, 3 more to members of various royal families, and one to a kid whose last name is on a building. You see what I'm getting at?*

***Everyone is a special case.***

*Year after year, people ask for ""Miracle Acceptance Stories"" only to be shot down by seemingly wise commenters who simply state ""There are no miracle acceptances.""* 

*Those commenters are wrong. There are miracle acceptances. Want an example? Miracle acceptances to the most selective colleges in America are people like you. People who have stellar stats, strong extracurriculars, and eloquent essays, but no hook.* 

*You have gone through high school and constantly achieved at a level above and beyond your classmates. But here? In this cold room at 86 Brattle Street? You are something that you haven't been in a long time. Average. No, not an average admit. An average applicant.*

*The two people you're competing against? They played the game. Expertly.*

""But that's not fair! I can't control the situation I was born into!""

*Nobody can! That's the whole point! The athlete gets good genetics, the legacy gets money, and the poor brown kid gets affirmative action! They understood their place. They recognized an imperfect process for what it is; imperfect!* 


*I've never seen someone post ""It's unfair that I didn't get into Stanford with a 1230! I'm a bad test taker!"" That would be absurd. We all know that high test scores are part of the deal for any top school. Bad at taking tests? Tough luck! Figure it out. Born a middle-class white kid? Know what is required. Adapt, or die. The cards you are dealt are not the end all be all, but knowing how to play them is.*


*The accepted students? They knew their edge from the second they were born. Or they made their own. And they exploited it for everything it was worth.*


***You did not.***






*Dear You,*


*The Committee on Admissions has completed its Regular Decision meetings, and I am very sorry to inform you that we cannot offer you admission to the Class of 2022.* 

*We very much appreciate the interest you have shown in Harvard, and we hope you will accept the best wishes of the Committee for success in all your future endeavors.*

910,fcwcrc,False,None,39,"Stressed, Anxious, Depressed, Or Overwhelmed? This Is For You",ApplyingToCollege,"Browsing A2C lately, I've noticed that a lot of you are barely treading water mentally.  Here are some of my reflections as someone who has been through it.  This is long, but it's true.  And it's for you.

TL:DR – Life is long.  You can make mistakes and come back from them.  College is just one small part of life, so don't stress too much over it. Focus on who you are, the skills you cultivate, the relationships you build, and the things you love.

1.  **You probably feel like no one understands what you're going through.**  People outside of the /r/A2C demographic are usually pretty unaware and out of touch with the issues students here are dealing with.  It is tragic that so many of you feel that several of the most important relationships in your life are defined or impacted by college admissions.  Parents who love their kids and want the best for them try to nudge them to do their best, but often they do it by bludgeoning them with pressure, doubt, insecurity, and even derision.  Friends who loved each other through thick and thin find themselves adversaries fighting for one hypothetical spot at their dream school.  So many of you lie awake at night worrying and wondering.  Your days are a hamster wheel and your true free time, ferociously earned or stolen through dereliction, is spent on coping mechanisms.  It's hard for anyone outside of this to even understand at all how challenging and consuming it can be.  You aren't alone in feeling this way.  And you're going to make it.

2.  **You might feel judged or weak for being so stressed, and that's ok.**  It's not weakness; it's normal.  Many people outside of college admissions wonder how these struggles can be real or why students subject themselves to it.  It is all real because it is real in your life, and for many of you it has become real in the core of who you are.  This is why some of you even suggest writing your essays about college admissions (please don't!).  Others go through a Stockholm syndrome metamorphosis and fall in love with it.  If you're struggling and feel like you have no hope, hang in there.

3.  **Don't do anything that could mess up the rest of your life permanently**. Life is long, and your time dealing with your current set of problems and stressors is coming to an end soon. When you go to college almost everything in your life can change and you can change with it.  You don't need to feel trapped, hemmed in, or limited by disappointment in who you are and what you currently struggle with.  Even if everything doesn't improve in college, you get another chance to ""reboot"" when you graduate and enter the workforce.  There are so few things in life that are permanent and once you establish independence as an adult you will be shocked by how much freedom you have to change things or do things differently.

4.  **Grades and test scores aren't everything.** I know many, many successful people who didn't manage a 3.0+ in high school OR college. All of them got jobs and are off to solid careers. You'll be fine if you can make it to college. I know people who did not make a 1000 on the SAT, but still went to college and now have successful careers.

5.  **Failure is a part of life, so never let one or two failures derail you**. Most successful entrepreneurs aren't very successful with their 1st or even 2nd and 3rd attempts to start a company. Most students get rejected from some colleges or internships. Well qualified and even over qualified candidates get rejected for jobs all the time. Researchers find ideas that don't work after years of pursuing them.  It's part of being human. Don't let failure or rejection bring you down or defeat you. Just remember, you can only go to one college, so it only takes one college to accept you. You only have one job or summer internship, so you only have to get one offer.

6.  **Once you go to college and establish your independence, it won't matter as much what other people think**. You will at some point be able to define for yourself what success means to you.  For most of you, success is being defined for you right now, but that isn't going to be true for much longer. Once you're in college or out on your own, you determine that for yourself.  In college, you can absolutely get a great support network between friends, roommates, professors, advisors, and teammates. Once you graduate you will have other opportunities to find supportive people in your life. If your existing relationships are terrible or toxic, remember that they aren't going to be as significant of a factor in your life once you head off to college.  Not even close. Hang in there and you'll be fine.

7.  **If you don't get in to your top choice, don't let it bother you**. There are tons of incredibly successful people who went to safety schools. Success isn't a one-time thing either. Graduating as valedictorian certainly helps you get a leg up on admissions to college, scholarships, etc. But it's not going to make you any friends, and no one is going to care once you start college. Even employers don't care about high school stats once you go to college. Once your career is off and running, your college GPA and performance won't matter as much either.  So stop panicking and obsessing over it and focus instead on living your life.

8.  **To be successful, you have to have good habits, work ethic, skills/talents/abilities, etc. You can't just succeed at one thing one time and declare yourself a success**. That's why your habits and steady state behaviors make a bigger impact than your one time accomplishments (like getting into your top choice, graduating #1, etc). If you're doing the right things, building skills and using them, and working hard, you'll be fine. Often, failing helps you hone those behaviors and skills much better than success does. A lot of successful people see failures as ""paying tuition"" to learn how things work or don't work.  Here's my point - Larry Page was an ok guy but he wasn't anything special in 1997. He went to Michigan for undergrad, and hadn't accomplished anything that remarkable. Sergey Brin was the same way - he went to Maryland (where his dad was a prof). But they started Google together and are now two of the richest and most successful people in history. Their careers at Google are riddled with mistakes and ""failures"" too. But they learned from it, and continued to work hard and get better.  Getting in to your dream school might feel like the pinnacle of existence right now, but it's far from the end goal.  Keep your focus on your own end goals and remember that going to college is just a step in that journey.  There are many paths to success, and going to any one specific college isn't going to make or break anything.  Relax.  You don't have to go to a top college to get a great education or have an incredibly rewarding life and career.  FAR more than where you go, it will matter what skills you cultivate, what relationships you build, and what you personally achieve and learn.  Life is stressful enough - don't pile on by worrying about some ""perfect"" trajectory or micromanaging the steps to attain some lofty goals.  Things rarely go according to plan.  They also rarely end with you destitute and living under a bridge.  No matter what happens in the next year or five, you will probably be fine.  In all honesty, the biggest risk in your life is not that you fail at the things you're working toward.  It's that you handle the stress poorly - turning to unhealthy eating, drugs, thrill-seeking, or whatever else to deal with it, battling depression & its repercussions, etc. 

9. **Try to relax**.  Remind yourself that life is long and you can still be crazy successful even if you don't get into your dream school.  Take a break.  Go for a walk.  Call a friend and talk about sports or celebrities or Fortnite or anything but college.  Get some exercise.  Read a book just for fun.  Plan some time in advance for you to spend unwinding.  If that means you have to work harder for a few days leading up to it so you have the bandwidth, then do it.  

10.  **Don't worry so much about where you go to college**. There are so many things that matter more than that in life. Your success in life will be far more dependent on the skills you build, the personal & professional relationships you curate, and how you perform wherever you end up. But more importantly, you need to worry about *you* right now too. Specifically, the habits you form, how you handle stress & anxiety, how you manage your mental health, what coping mechanisms you pursue, how you balance long term and short term goals, and even how you define success in the first place.  It may surprise you, but [most of the top 1% of students **by any measure** do not attend an Ivy League school](https://old.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/7yprmn/most_of_the_top_1_of_students_nationally_by_any/).  The entire top 40 of colleges represents just ~3% of all students.  You can be in the top 5% of students nationally (again, *by any measure*) and still not attend a T40.  The take away here is that you should focus on yourself and who you want to be, not on a specific college or sub set of colleges.  There are tons of colleges where you could go get a world-class education and be successful.  You don't have to go to a top 20 school to be successful, in fact even if you can, it might not be the best option for you.  The rankings aren't that valuable or reliable anyway because of how and why they are produced and what they mean. After college, no one uses the rankings. Employers hire people, not undergraduate brands.  It's a controversial bomb to drop, but it's the truth. Sure if you want to be on the Supreme Court someday, you probably need a law degree from a top school. But for most of us, mind-blowing levels of success are very attainable almost no matter where we get our education.  You have options.  There are over 4600 degree granting colleges in the United States. Many hundreds of these are great schools offering a world class education and pre-professional training. You might have a list of ~10. Guess what? Even if you go 0-10, you can still go to a great college. There are good colleges with later deadlines or rolling admissions. You can take a gap year. This is not your only shot at an amazing college education.

11.  **Don't give up**.  Once May rolls around, you'll be glad you stuck with it. After your first job out of college, no one will care what your GPA was, what your test scores were, or even where you went to school. Who you are, the work ethic you build, the habits you have, and the relationships you form will have a bigger impact on your future than your SAT, GPA, or really anything from high school or college.  Life is long and being successful in high school and going to college is not a one-shot, winner-take-all, do-or-die affair. If you don't get accepted at ANY of your top schools, or you have a 500 SAT, or a 1.4 GPA, or someone royally screwed you over somehow, or whatever - you can still have a successful life. Almost any failure or circumstance can be overcome later. You almost always have another opportunity to succeed.

12.  **If you're feeling overwhelmed by deadlines, relax**. They will come and go. You'll get your stuff done or you won't. But there will be many other chances to figure things out. If you are in a near-death battle with senioritis, [take steps now to address it before it gets worse](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/e5s8ud/how_to_handle_senioritis/).

13.  **If it helps, the sensation that you aren't good enough and that you don't know how to handle the pressure and expectations being foisted upon you never really goes away**. [Imposter syndrome is real](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/edyphz/how_to_handle_imposter_syndrome/) and you need to have reasonable expectations for yourself to keep things in perspective both in college and in your career.  No matter what company you go to after graduation, someone will be way more successful than you. If you start your own business, there will be other business owners who are way more successful and distinguished. I'll put it this way - if you think this sub is bad, wait until you become a working professional and get on LinkedIn.  At some point, you have to just set some goals for yourself and define success on your own terms. Then work to achieve what you want out of life without obsessing over what other people are doing. You will be surprised how much better you feel about yourself if you work on yourself for yourself rather than constantly comparing yourself to people who are better than you. (And there is always someone better than you - richer, taller, younger, smarter, sexier, more successful, more accomplished, more talented, more athletic, etc.) But the comparisons do you no good whatsoever. Set your own goals, then go be you.

14.  **Take care of your mental health and recognize that little steps can get you on the right track quickly**.  If you're struggling, get some help.  Talk to a friend, parent, or counselor.  You aren't alone and there are many people going through the same feelings of stress and anxiety.  Life is long.  You *will* make mistakes and suffer failures - that's life.  But you also get **so. many. chances.** to come back from them.  It's never too late.  Ray Kroc started McDonalds at age 59.  Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote ""Little House in the Big Woods"" at age 65.  You could literally fail out of high school, spend a year in trade school, and be making $80k as a corporate welder in a low cost of living area by age 19 (this happened to a friend of mine who finished high school with a 1.9 GPA).  You could write a hit book like Stephanie Meyer (who started writing Twilight at age 30).  You could start your own successful business like a friend of mine who recently retired with a lake house and a beach house (after being fired or laid off from his first 3 jobs).",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fcwcrc/stressed_anxious_depressed_or_overwhelmed_this_is/,936,"Imposter syndrome is misunderstood.

I see some of the 2020 gang applying to all the t10s and their state school and being completely shocked when they get 1 acceptance. I don't care how good you think your application is, unless you're Greta Thunberg, you should apply to a range of schools. Apply to some with a 15% acceptance rate, but also some with a 50% acceptance rate and definitely a couple with a 70%+ acceptance rate.

**It kills me** to see some people on this sub who have accomplished amazing things and gotten fantastic GPAs and test scores have no choices besides community college and taking a gap year. Of course, those are two perfectly fine options, but it sucks if you are being forced into those options, and you deserve to have a choice.

**Don't even come at me** with that ""but my SAT was in their 25-75 percentile! I never could have predicted rejection!"". You have to know that a school with a <30% acceptance rate will look at things besides your SAT score. Having stats in the range of t20s doesn't mean you are likely to get in. It opens a door for you to be considered admission (disclaimer: of course there are those who have stats lower than the range but make up for it by being fantastic in all other aspects and you all are amazing!)

If you did not know that, I'm sorry you had to be disillusioned like this. My friend had a 36 ACT and 4.0 UW GPA and was appalled when she didn't get into Stanford today, because she thought that her stats were enough, when really, **it's so much more than that**. I'm not saying the system is right or wrong, but that's what we're working with.

Also, some of y'all are like ""but I did 3 internships and wrote a published research paper and volunteered 300+ hours and started a nonprofit but only got into my state school wtf1!1!!"" And to that, I say, I'm sorry. That sucks. But, when you look at the schools these people apply to, many of them just apply to HYPSM and then one safety school, and ask themselves where they went wrong.

It's just really sad, because there are so many amazing applicants that shotgunned all the t20s or Ivys or UCs and got rejected/waitlisted from all of them, when they would have gotten accepted at t40s or t50s. For example, if you love Yale, by all means, apply! But also apply to some other low reaches/high matches/low matches/safeties.

See here, a balanced profile: Yale(6%), Boston University(18.5%), Northeastern(19%), University of Florida(31.4%), Purdue (58%) , Clemson(51%), VATech (70%), Loyola University New Orleans,(90%)  University of Maine(91%)

See here, a foolish profile (sorry if I call you out): Ivy league, MIT, Stanford, UC Hicago, Caltech, some selective UCs OOS, and the University of Wyoming.

I know that this is not a popular belief, especially right after rejection season. I've gotten many rejections as well, and it hurts big time, but Class of 2021, you just **need to be practical** about your applications. I know that a t50 doesn't sound as exciting to those of you who are conditioned to only accept ivy leagues or UCs, but if you don't like your state school/safety, you need to find some more safe options. **t20s and even t30s are NOT your safety/match schools** (rare exceptions of course), so find a range of schools. PS (GATech isn't ur fucking safety school if you're OOS!).

I swear to God, if I see any of you 21ers out there next year like ""shit got rejected from my safety, UC Irvine and my match, Cornell/SUNY Ithaca"", blood will be shed in this chat!

Sincerely,

A concerned senior

926,cbp698,False,None,72,Don't Fantasize,ApplyingToCollege,"Hello everyone. I'm a senior who graduated two months ago and would like to warn all you upcoming seniors about your college application process. The past year has been rough for me and the college application experience was fucking brutal. Hear me out for a second. I am a computer science major who applied to 10 schools and they were hard to get into for CS. I am an Illinois in the Chicago area resident and I applied to schools such as UMich, UIUC, Berkeley, UCLA, Carnegie Mellon, and the likes. I ended up getting rejected by all except two of my safeties (UIC and Loyola) after being waitlisted and given blue balls by Berkeley. When I was rejected by my schools I was devastated as I felt like my hard work was a waste of time. I decided to commit to UIC and I wasn't happy.

&#x200B;

Here's the point: Please do not believe that hard work alone will get you where you want to be at.  I remember grinding the SAT practice tests while watching videos about student life at my schools. I went through a lot of anxiety and worrying my senior year believing that maybe, JUST MAYBE, all my hard work and challenges would put me in a school where I would enjoy myself. I imagined myself on campus, where I would spend my time at making friends at my schools, and what activities I would be a part of. DO NOT DO THIS. It's like the saying ""don't celebrate too early"". Until you get accepted that's when you can start fantasizing. As much as we like to imagine that the world is just and that in the end we get everything we deserve, it is not like that. We like to imagine fairy-tale scenarios. The sooner you realize that you cannot control this shit is when you finally understand how to be happy. Please do not say ""I'm for sure getting into this school"" because when you don't, it is devastating. Life doesn't give a fuck about what you had to go through, you just gotta accept what it throws at you and make the best of it. I remember spending hundreds of hours reading about past students' stats and calculating my chances of getting in. I used to say stuff like ""I'll be the lucky one who defines the odds"". It was all a huge waste of time.

&#x200B;

After cooling off for the past couple of months, I'm not even mad about going to UIC. In fact, it may have been a huge lesson being rejected from all these schools as it taught me that hard work doesn't equal a good future. Luck is a big part in all of this too. So make smart investments and don't put too much effort / emotional investment into something that is not certain. The whole process is like gambling, it gives you a rush and if you lose it can hurt you. Good luck, upcoming seniors and please, be realistic. Don't fantasize about a perfect future but rather make the most of the present moment.

934,bkri0k,False,Major Advice,84,I beg of you; PLEASE apply to safeties (The Gut Feeling: My College Decisions Experience),ApplyingToCollege,"Like I said, please apply for safeties, and I mean colleges that you LIKE and are 100% certain that you are going to get into. I've had friends who only applied to matches and reaches for either undergrad or grad/med school because they were confident, but ended up getting rejected everywhere. Safeties can normally save you in the worst case scenario, so apply to safeties.

Getting my main point across, here's my experience with college decisions this year.

I'm a senior who initially decided to apply for Computer Science at UCs, Cal Poly SLO, USC, Harvey Mudd, and Brown. Around November of last year was when I had to choose which UCs I would apply to. I saw Davis, Irvine, and Santa Barbara as match schools, and I was confident that I would get into one of these schools. Maybe my GPA was a bit low, but my other stats could balance my application out. I selected the top 6 UCs and saw adding the ""lower-tiered"" ones as unnecessary because of how much money the applications costed, as well as the idea of prestige.

However, as I was finishing up my UC application on the final week of November, I felt an ominous gut feeling that told me to add UC Riverside and UC Santa Cruz to my list. I felt as though if I didn't include them, something terrible would happen. I didn't have a reason of why, but I didn't want to risk ignoring my gut feeling. Going back to my UC application, I added both of them as safeties and then submitted my application.

If I had ignore my instinct then, I wouldn't be in college right now.

Turns out that my safeties were my targets, and my targets were my reaches. I got accepted to both Riverside and Santa Cruz for Computer Science first, which made me feel relieved. However, after that was constant rejection from every other school. Got rejected from every other college I applied to, with a single waitlist from UC San Diego.

It hurts getting punched in the gut with 9 rejections in a row, and there are so many people on San Diego's waitlist that it's nearly impossible to get off. However, without my initial acceptances, I would be hurting much more inside, having to accept that I wouldn't be able to start on a campus my 1st year.

I'm glad that I'm lucky enough to get accepted in a college and get that gut feeling that changed my future for the next four years. I'm lucky that I'm going to a school where I love the environment and can focus on CS, a topic that I actually care about. For the next 4 years, I'm proud to say that I'll be attending UC Santa Cruz with plans to major in Computer Science.

Rising seniors and future years, regardless of how confident you are, how high your grades are, or what you have done, apply to safeties that you would enjoy going to, and make sure that your targets aren't actually reaches. College admissions is an incredibly random and competitive process. Sure, there are people who manage to get into college while applying to no safeties or even only reaches. However, don't risk trying that like what I nearly did. Add more safeties. Good luck, and do your best! 😃

-A Rising College Freshman

TL;DR: I trusted a gut feeling that determined whether I got into college or not. Thank god.

936,9cqs7s,False,None,243,Caught cheating. Regret my decision every day.,ApplyingToCollege,"About a year ago I was like a lot of people on here preparing to apply to colleges. One day while I'm driving a friend home from school I ask him where he's thinking about applying. He tells me that race/ethnicity in college admissions is HUGE and you can simply lie about it and get a big boost. He tells me there's no punishment if you get caught. After spending weeks researching the whole ""race factor"" in college admissions, I decided I'd lie on college admissions and claim I was latino/hispanic (I'm white). If colleges asked anything I'd simply tell them I was columbian. 


I apply to selective instituions marking myself as Hispanic/Latino. In the weeks following I experienced stress and anxiety over my decision I never thought I would. Every email, every letter in the mail, and every visit to the guidance counselors office caused stress. I even had some nightmares about getting caught. Eventually acceptances and rejections rolled out. I thought at this point I was in the clear. I pick my college, buy apparel for it, update my social media bios, tell all my friends and family, and at my school they post colleges with the name of the students attending them in the hall.


In June, which at this point I had graduated from HS, I'm at a concert with friends. I get a phone call from my college. I don't answer but she leaves a message. She informs me that they performed an audit and noticed on ""old records"" (I have no idea what these records were or how they got them) my parents marked me as caucasian and that on my ACT profile I was marked as caucasian. She asks for a call back. My stomach dropped when I read this voicemail (I have a transcriber). I went to a porta potti and puked for over an hour. I had to tell all my friend I was just sick. And on the train ride home I had a panic attack. I had enormous chest pains, shortness of breath, and shaking. I honestly thought I was gonna die. 


I got home and planned my next lie. The next day I called and answered questions from an associate dean who didn't sound at all suspicious despite my nervous voice. I told him I had recently found out my Dad is columbian (since I never knew and still don't know my dad). After the conversation he tells me thanks and they'll email me if they have any more questions. On Tuesday I get an email from them informing me they'd like a written letter from my parents and guidance counselor confirming my assertion that I was columbian. 


At this point the jig is up. I email them informing them I'd like to withdraw my enrollment from the school and that I will no longer me attending. For the next week and a half I ignore multiple phone calls and emails from them. Eventually they just called my school and told my guidance counselor what happened. My guidance counselor at the direction of the college, or maybe his own volition I don't know, informs every college I applied to and he calls my Mom. 


Every college I was accepted rescinded my acceptance. My Mom and grandparents were angry as you can imagine. But they eventually understood the pressure I had on me to get into a good college and forgave me. I decided to enroll at a Community College, which is where I'm at now. I had to come up with a lie to all of my friends and family that I couldn't afford to go to a 4-year. 


I now live in fear that when I apply again in two years my counselor will inform all of the schools of my history, and I'll forever be blacklisted as a cheater. I live every day regretting my decision. I hate Community College so much and feel like I wasted 4 years of work just so I would have a slightly better chance at some schools. Thankfully, if there's any silver lining, I avoided any legal trouble since I was accepted without financial aid. I'm writing this to hopefully clear some conscious and improve my poor ethics (which I still have). I'll probably get a lot of hate on this post, which is understandable. I wish I would've known about this reddit a year ago, and I wish someone would've made a post like this. So they know it's not worth it. 



TL;DR Don't cheat the college admissions. It's 100% not worth it. You'll probably get caught. And if you don't get caught you'll have to live in fear that you may be caught.

945,gwx3tk,False,Discussion,37,Proof the waitlist pulls through sometimes,ApplyingToCollege,"For context: 1530 SAT, 3.9 GPA, solid extracurriculars including a very exclusive internship, and strong essays. I had a brutal admissions process. I applied to a bunch of T20 and T40 business schools - rejected by nearly every school besides a few targets and my safeties. Spent a lot of time trying to figure out where I went wrong, questioning myself, etc. Eventually got over it and figured I would be alright because I was happy with some of the target schools I got accepted to. Got the financial aid for my target schools and couldn't come close to affording any of them, leaving me with only one option -- my state school. I had been waitlisted by one target and one reach, but I had low expectations so I lived as though I was going to my state school. And then the call came. The school I had no hopes of getting into was offering me a spot. ""I am calling to offer you a spot at Cornell's Dyson School."" The school I applied to on a whim just because of its state tuition benefits. The school I figured I had the least chance of getting into, given its 3% acceptance rate. After getting rejected from every other school on and even below its level, for some reason they waitlisted me. I still had no hope because the waitlist itself was about a 3% chance to get off of. But they saw something on me that apparently none of the other schools saw, and they gave me a chance. Waitlist miracles do happen.

**Questbridge College Match:**

I found out about Questbridge the summer before my senior year. I somehow managed to ask for recommendation letters two weeks before the deadline because of a late school start. I learned so much about myself through the Questbridge process. There are so many little things about me that I have never realized before. I ranked 12 schools for the Questbridge College Match, and I was not matched to any of them. I later switched to ED I for the University of Pennsylvania and ED II for Tufts University. I got rejected from both.

&#x200B;

**Regular Decision:**

I finalized my regular decision a few days after I got my rejection from the University of Pennsylvania. I applied to nearly every QB partner because I assumed they have good financial aid on top of my Common App ones.

&#x200B;

**How I organized:**

I am a google drive folder nerd. I created a [google drive folder](https://imgur.com/gy50uEa) for my college application stuff. Inside this **Whole Bunch of Schools** folder, I have six individual folders: **Scholarships**, **Regular Decision Schools**, **Questbridge**, **LORs**, **Common App**, and **College lists** [screenshot](https://imgur.com/Dp5ygSX).

There is a **Submitted** folder inside the **Scholarship** so I could keep track of what scholarships I have applied to [screenshot](https://imgur.com/D63DDjZ).

There are four folders inside the **Regular Decision Schools**: **QB**, **Own**, **Common App**, and **College Match** [screenshot](https://imgur.com/4C84Jjq). The number next to the folder name indicates how many schools I applied were in that category. All the numbers added up to 51. Let’s take a peek inside. I have two folders inside **QB** named **1** and **2** [screenshot](https://imgur.com/rHgdf9l). **1** is all January 1st deadline schools [screenshot](https://imgur.com/NMDdLad). **2** is all January 15th or after. It is important to organize them so you know what supplement you should be working on to make sure you turn everything in by the deadline. **Own** only has one school [screenshot again](https://imgur.com/6nNxpgw). I used the same 1,2 method for my **Common App** folder. **College Match** has all my Questbridge Match schools.

**Questbridge** has all my Questbridge essays.

**LORs** is all about recommendation letters. I created a brag sheet for all my teachers. I also have my **LOCI** (Letter of Continued Interest) folder in here.

**Common App** is full of common app essay ideas. I wrote three essays for my Common App, but I ended up using my Questbridge biographical essay for Common App.

**College Lists**, like the name suggests, is full of college lists. I have my regular decision list, Questbridge match list, and lists of colleges with stats in here.

The rest of my college folder is unorganized. It has my interview questions and dates, thank you emails, working schedule, official test score list, mid-year report list, major plan, activities list, financial aid deadline spreadsheet, and FA submission sheet.

&#x200B;

**Financial Aid:**

I included two dates for every school on my [regular decision list](https://imgur.com/bRKFgg7). All schools were color coded. Red for Questbridge regular decision, blue for Common App regular decision, green for Questbridge College Match, and yellow for own application (not included in the screenshot because it is at the very bottom of the document). You might wonder what those dates were. The first date was the application deadline. The second date was the financial aid deadline. This document was very useful to me when I tried to track every deadline. I would highlight the date after I submitted my application or financial documents. I have a [FA submission document](https://imgur.com/vh2QMxQ). I color coded this document as well. As you can see, I submitted my FAFSA in waves because FAFSA only allows you to submit 10 schools at a time. If you need financial aid, make sure you give yourself enough time to submit them by the deadline. The same rule applies for CSS Profile. I also created a [financial aid deadline spreadsheet](https://imgur.com/Iz894np). I know it looks confusing to you. It basically has all the deadlines and just some random things I need to remind myself of. Do not ever feel like you have to use a spreadsheet. I really like my google doc, and I think it worked better for me than a spreadsheet. You can use whatever tool you want to keep track of all your deadlines.

# If you are asking for a lot of financial aid, make sure you check to see if the school is need-blind. This was one of my biggest mistakes I made during the application process. I assumed that 100% need met schools are all need-blind. I was WRONG. There was no surprise when I got rejected by all need-aware schools that meet 100% need.

&#x200B;

**Waiting process and Interviews:**

Waiting was the hardest. I had no clue what was about to happen. One advice I can give on this topic is to really love your safety school. Make sure you applied to somewhere you would not mind attending. My safety was the University of Minnesota and that was my first acceptance. My financial aid package was not good. My in-state safety turned out to be my most expensive one, which is kind of ironic. I could certainly make it work, but it would be a struggle after getting multiple school-specific scholarship rejections. I looked at the dorms. I calculated the cost and where I could get money to cover everything. I would say that I was pretty settled with the University of Minnesota. I knew I would be going to college, and I knew that the University of Minnesota would not be a bad choice for me.

I know one thing about applying to so many colleges is that I would receive more rejections. There was a time where I got 10+ rejections in a day. I had sad tears. I had happy tears. I would never forget those moments when I opened up my decision letter and it said “Congratulations!”

Let’s talk about interviews. I had nine interviews in total. I did interviews for Brown, Grinnell, Hamilton, Haverford, Oberlin, Wellesley, Stanford, Columbia, and Princeton. Interviews are simply conversations. Interviewers want to know more about you. I think it would be helpful to find some interview questions online and practice them ahead of time. One of the most common questions is “tell me about yourself”. This question is hard because you don't know what to start. Make sure you have your activity sheet somewhere near you because you might forget about everything during the interview. Trust me. It happens. I did all my interviews on Skype except for Princeton so I could not comment much on how you should dress for an interview. I did one of my interviews in pajamas. Enough said.

&#x200B;

**Scholarships**:

I did get a few very generous local scholarships. I will suggest you apply to as many local scholarships as you possibly can. There is less competition and the amount is usually pretty good. If you get admitted to any college, please make sure you check their financial aid policy on outside scholarships. Some colleges allow you to keep the extra money if the total amount of scholarships exceeds the cost of attendance. Some colleges don't let you go beyond their cost of attendance and will reduce aid accordingly. Most schools will reduce loans and work-study before they reduce their grant. In this case, please look at your financial package to see how much money you would need to cover the cost of attendance. You should apply to local scholarships, however, you should stop applying for more once you have reached your money goal and the cost of attendance is covered. You will not be able to keep the extra money anyway, might as well leave it for someone else who needs it the most.

&#x200B;

**Final Note:**

Please keep in mind that the college process is completely random. I can not tell you whether or not you should shotgun schools, but I hope this post helps some juniors who are thinking about applying to a large number of colleges. If you do end up applying to a lot of schools, please make sure you double check your supplements before you submit them. It is common to recycle essays, but you have to make sure you do not put the wrong college name. You should take the time to write each supplement. Every school is different so you really have to do your research. I started submitting essays three days before the deadline because I knew I needed extra time to double check everything. You do not want to make silly mistakes after all that effort you have put into this process. Do not afraid to dream big. The college process is overwhelming and we all know that every year it is only getting worse. The result doesn't define who we are and what amazing things we are able to do in our lives. You can learn at just about everywhere.

&#x200B;

So this is it. This is my college process. I will be the first person in my family to graduate from high school and to attend college.

[**HERE IS THE DECISION DATE COMPILATION SHEET**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12NnsHOjtevUATb-yYIgDFFLyYajiHxhJ6xHiJnIXj-8/edit)


---

Hello everyone! It's here at last, the RD/ED II megathread. Spring is in the air, and with it, the hint of college decisions. 


If you want an official megathread for a particular college, send me a PM or comment below with the college's name and, if you have it, the exact date and time of the decisions release. Please give me ample time (~1-4 days before the decision date) to create your megathread, otherwise, the results might come out before I am able to fulfill the request.

College acceptance megathreads will be listed below, as well as expected release dates and times for those not yet released. If you have any information about release dates, please send me a PM/leave a comment with that information so it can be included in this thread.

DO NOT create a new thread about your acceptances or an unofficial school megathread. Such threads will be removed on sight.
We're excited to celebrate your achievements with you!

Here are my ideas so far: 

* They must bring their transcripts to the party. I will be checking GPA's at the door (4.5 weighted and above only😛)
* A shot for every school you've applied to 
* AP Chem students who got a 5 get to tend the bar
   * They also get first pass on the weed but they have to thoroughly explain the combustion reaction formula happening as they take a hit
* Girls (who are National Merit Scholars) get in free😜👏
* USC commits have to pay to get in.
* Leave the drama😤at home😴(no college shaming) 

&#x200B;

Obviously this post is satirical but this party is actually happening so some aspects of this will be used...please drop down any other AP/tryhard/nerd themed ideas bc I'd really appreciate it for my party

964,fo52vz,False,Serious,23,As the Ivy Day approaches...,ApplyingToCollege,"It easy for our friends, parents, relatives, and others to form an opinion of us based on the colleges that we get into. But, for us, it is important to remember that ""opinion"" is a just a social construct; its made-up, its not necessarily your reality. And ***""Someone's opinion of you does not have to become your reality.""*** **(Les Brown)** Be it your haters or your very loved ones. Only you and you should define yourself.

It great if you get into those IVY leagues, Stanford, Caltech, MIT, or the reputed T20s. You sure have a kickstart to your professional life with the networks you will create and the opportunities you will take advantage of. Be happy and rejoice, you deserve it. However, to think that this success makes you superior to your peers who didn't get into these colleges is outrightly incorrect. Sometimes, we adopt such a thinking unconsciously; like we start treating ourselves differently if we get into a great college and vice-versa. (I've seen it with a couple of my friends) Does a college decision determine how ""able"" we are/were? No. Do rejections discount the hard-work we put into our exams, classes, ECs, and essays? No. Does an acceptance somehow enhance ""the road that we have already traversed""? No. They, why do we let ourselves affected by them so much? Sure, an acceptance could give us validation for the work that we have done. But, if validation is all what you seek, don't forget that ""college decisions"" are not the only way.

If you are doing good work, putting in ""those extra hours of hardwork outside your comfort zones"", and heading towards your dreams slowly but persistently, you are sure to get tons of ""validations"" in future. You will get medals, your work will be published in reputed journals, and you will eventually get  recognitions for the work you do. Just be unstoppable. And, as Steve Jobs said *""Believe that the dots will somehow connect in the future. Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to keep working, even when it leads you off the well worn path.""*

**Don't put so much weight on the decision part.** It sure is difficult, but this mental detachment is essential for you to keep moving forward. If you get acceptances, don't just start assuming that you will do well with everything you do in future. If you get rejections, don't behave as if you've lost on everything, and all the work that you have done means nothing. Learn what went wrong with you and what went right. And keeping working.

Also, remember that the admission officer that judges you is not the wisest man/woman on earth. He/she could have had prejudices and your decision is of-course dependent on uncountable unpredictable factors. Don't let him/her take control of the ""most defining moment of your life"". What I mean to say is that don't think of an admission decision as the ""most defining moment"". You were born to do greater things than just getting into good colleges. Take that burden off your shoulders. Breath in. Breath out. And focus on the longer journey.

[I posted a while ago asking if it was a good idea to write my Common App essay on my former heroin addiction.](https://old.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/a04lbp/heroin_addiction_in_essays/)

I was deferred from my REA and accepted to my state school. I visited my state school and fell in love with it and realized I didn't care if I got rejected from all the top schools. So, for my RD schools, I decided to do it, against everyone's advice. I wrote the essay, it was beautiful. Showed it to my counselor and she cried (and then she told me to not submit it).

Anyways, I got rejected from all my RD schools, lol. My counselor apparently talks to the AOs though (?!?) and they said they liked/loved my essay, but couldn't convince the rest of the AOs to vote for a former heroin addict. My counselor said that the AOs said they really can't vibe with essays that involve drugs, alcohol, sex/rape, or violence. 

BUT, I got into my REA school after being deferred!!!!! So I guess everything works out in the end?

EDIT: To clarify (I've rephrased the post, too), I wrote a ""tame"" but good essay for my EA and REA schools, and then applied with my heroin essay to RD schools.

You guys. 

Be real.

Don’t be ashamed of your awkward self. Some of y’all don’t have social skills because you’re not social, not because you tried hard in school. 

It’s so annoying to see this narrative of people feeling like they missed out on high school because they tried so hard at school. This isn’t real. You were weird or awkward or lacked any romantic finesse with the opposite/desires sex.

You’ll get into a good school, enroll, and then continue to be awkward. This won’t change. You are who you are. Embrace it. 

In a way, this should be comforting. Your lack of a social life is your own fault. Don’t blame your academic success on your miserable high school years. So if you don’t get into a good school, don’t mourn your lost high school experiences; you wouldn’t have had them anyway.

981,c4umsk,False,None,91,Why I Feel More Depressed After Getting Into An Ivy,ApplyingToCollege,"To give you guys a little bit of background, during my college application season I shot gunned to all the east coast schools and other T20 schools. I worked extremely hard in high school, really only thinking about college my junior year. At the same time I wanted to excel, and put myself in the best situation to gain the necessary skills and connections to help others. 

After getting rejected and waitlisted to all my top choices, I had to choose between UCLA and UC Berkeley. Ultimately I chose UCLA for a number of reasons including that I realized that in order to accomplish my goals of helping others, I first needed to take care of myself. Before choosing UCLA I was in a slump, thinking that I had failed by getting rejected into 10+colleges. I felt like I failed everyone around me, wasted the opportunity given to me by so many people that pushed me to who I am today. I felt like I failed the future people that I know couldn’t reach. But UCLA is an AMAZING school, and I started learning more of how just lucky I was.

So fast forward to the the month of May, where I had already started looking at internship, research, and entrepreneurship resources at UCLA, I started feeling  way more at home especially considering how much I liked the overall people and school spirit. Also a bunch of my friends were going and we started planning out meetups and everything!

Then it dropped, I got off the waitlist to UPenn, which I  had previously already gave up on. (Last year 9/2500 people got off). It was an unbelievable miraculous moment. I felt elated, absolutely stunned at everything. 

My family and I instantly booked a plane ride to philly to visit the campus and as the days trickled by, I realized that this wasn’t an easy choice. I didn’t really connect with the campus much, and I had long arguments with my parents about which to choose. (They obviously wanted me to go to Penn despite the financial cost). To give you guys more context, my parents are both from China, where they value education over everything else. So as middle class individuals we didn’t receive any financial aid, but they were willing to take the financial hit of around 160k (Yeah it’s that expensive). I know that sounds great! But from my perspective I’m going to have to pay all of that back no matter what. So even if I’m not in debt to some bank, that’s still my debt that I’ll have to pay off to my parents. So although it’s not crippling, I still have “debt”. 

In the end (as you can tell by the tittle) I chose Penn. I really had to dig deep, and some part of me knew that I couldn’t pass up this opportunity. This was what I had wanted all along. But along the way something in me had changed. I KNEW I was going to be happier at UCLA with an amazing location, weather, food, and just overall an amazing place to study. I love the people there, the vibe and the culture. But I wanted more, I was ambitious and decided that it’s now or never, if I were go out in life always prioritize my own happiness, I’d never be able to accomplish my goals. So I chose my ambition over my happiness and now I’m not sure I made the right choice.

Over the past month I realized that getting into Penn didn’t make me happy, in fact I’m not even close to happy. There’s always another goal to reach, another obstacle to overcome, and someone else that’s always better than you. Since I was interested in entrepreneurship, my next goal is to transfer into Wharton and get a double degree from both the engineering and business school. But again, just like getting into Penn, this is incredibly difficult and unlikely, and this time I may not be so likely.

In the end, I’m not even sure if what I said about Penn being a once in a life time opportunity is correct. I mentioned how my parents put a lot of pressure on me to choose Penn, but usually I can ignore that stuff, but I’d be lying if I didn’t say it affected me. My mom and dad were playing good cop bad cop. My dad was constantly yelling, being incredibly emotional and basically throwing up every time I mentioned going to UCLA. On the other hand, my mom was being extremely manipulative telling me about how my dad was so pent on penn that he was in risk of heart attacks and depression. Like how can you not let this stuff go to your head?! How in the world could I have chose UCLA?

So in the end, I don’t regret my choice of going to Penn, but I just feel like I was FORCED to go to Penn over what I wanted for my personal well being. I definitely wonder to myself what if I chose UCLA, would I be feeling happier?  Would it solve all my problems? If you guys have any tips or things to say to me, go right ahead in the comments.

So for all of you rising seniors, I just want to impart some wisdom. Chose the school that you fit into and love if you can, not the one based on rankings or prestige. Also for those that are already in college or thinking about what college really means, just know that goals don’t make you happy, you make yourself happy. We’ve been taught over and over again that success is equivalent to happiness, but that’s not always the case. There will always be another goal whether it’s success or failure, but what we take away is not the end but the journey. And if you’re not happy along the way, the goal is meaningless. So take your time, and figure out not what your goals are, but if you’d be happy accomplishing those goals.

986,f9zxlk,False,Shitpost Wednesdays,96,Ranking t20s based on the distance to the closest Chick Fil A,ApplyingToCollege,"Everyone has their own metrics for judging how good a school is, maybe small class size makes a school more attractive, maybe it's a great grad school, or maybe it's an insane ratio of women to men students (I'm looking at you, American!) In any case, everyone has a different perspective on what makes a college truly great, and everyone ranks colleges differently. It is because of this discontinuity that I am pleased to announce: 

The A2C Ranking list of US News T20s and A Couple of Other Schools I Liked Based on their Proximity relative to Chick Fil A According to Google Maps (Or the A2CRLOUST20AACOOSILBOTPROCFAATGM for short). It is my hope that this life In this list will finally provide us with a stable metric on what ranking colleges really are. I've ranked the us news top 20 undergrad schools, along with some other schools I thought were cool. The results were as follows:

# #2: UVA, with a distance of 0.2 miles to the nearest chick fil a, it will take you approximately 5 minutes to walk there. Definitely worth it, Chick-Fil-As in the south are always incredible. Kind staff, good food, and an all-around great atmosphere, I've never been but I'm going to assume that it is amazing because it is a Chick Fil A.
# #3-5: Duke, Caltech, and William and Mary, with a distance of 0.3 miles to the nearest Chick Fil A. Big shoutouts to these schools for having super close chick fil as that you can easily walk to under the cover of buildings, so if it's raining or something you can get there while staying relatively dry. 
# #6: Georgetown. Georgetown also has a distance of 0.3 miles, but it appears to be an on campus chick fil a, making it worse than normal. No good thing has ever come from an on-campus chick fil a but you gotta give them credit for trying. Nice job georgetown!
Keep in mind the top 6 all take appoximately 6 minutes to get to from the center of campus as described by google maps
# #7: Rice, with a distance of 0.6 miles, taking approximately 15 minutes to get there.
# #8-11: UPenn, American, Notre Dame, and Vanderbilt. Each is approximately 0.7 miles away from Chick Fil a, and it will take an estimated 15 minutes to walk there.
# #12: Washingotn University in St. Louis. Washington is special because you need to cut across a park to get to the Chick Fil A, which is nice and calm. It takes about an hour to walk the 2.6 miles required to get there, but it looks like a nice walk, and I wouldn't mind strolling by on a sunny day on my way to the chick fil a. Yay. Alliteration.
# #13: Johns Hopkins, which takes 1 hour to travel the 3 miles required to get there. Johns Hopkins was a pain to find because searching ""chick fil a near to johns hopkins"" brought me to some random road like 8 hours outside of the city so I had to find chick fil a myself by searching for chick fil as in baltimore.
# #14 Emory University, which takes 1 hour to travel the 3 miles required.
# #15: Northwestern. 3.7 miles. 1.16 hours. Keep in mind when I type like ""1.16 hours"" that just means 1hour 16 minutes, im just too lazy to type it all out correctly
# #16 Brown, 4.8 miles, 1.37 hours
# #17 Columbia, 5.8 miles, 2 hours. How are there not more chick fil a in new york city. That's baffling to me. glad i didn't apply
# #18 Yale, 5.9 miles, 2 hours. 
# #19 UMich 6.6 miles, 2.12 hours. However, the chick fil a near UMich is an Express Chick Fil A in another university, so not only is it far away, but it's probably really bad too. 0/10 would not recommend applying to UMich. (EDIT: APPARENTLY this chick fil a is fine. nice.)
# #20 UC Hicago: 7.3 miles. 2.26 hours. I'm not gonna recommend you walk alone through Chicago at night just cuz ur hungry, but for Chick Fil A it might be worth it.

# #21 Stanford: 7.8 miles, 2.44 hours
# #22-23: Harvard and MIT, 8.8 miless, 3 hours
# #24: Princeton: 12.7 miles, 4.4 hours away. Very sad!


And now, our special mentions. You probably noticed that #1 was missing. This is due to just how incredibly small the distance is. You could practically crawl to chick fil a here, and it would still only take you about 5 minutes. With that introduction, I present to you:

# #1 UCLA! UCLA absolutely demolishes the competition with a distance of **EIGHTY FIVE FEET!!1** it would take you approximately **ONE MINUTE** to walk to chick fil a from UCLA, making it our top school in the A2CRLOUST20AACOOSILBOTPROCFAATGM ranking system. 

Now, for sadder news. Coming in at last place, we have Cornell and Dartmouth. 

# #24-25 Cornell: 59.4 miles, and 19 hours. Even worse is Dartmouth, with 91 miles and 34 hours walking speed. I could walk to Baltimore from my home in Virginia before I could walk to a chick fil a from dartmouth or Cornell. honestly quite shameful. very displeased.


In conclusion. UCLA absolutely owns the competition with an incredible performance, but lots of schools located in the Southeast United States give UCLA a run for it's money. Schools up north or on the west coast traditionally performed very poorly, probably because they are more liberal and hate chick fil a for some reason. buncha nerds tbh. if you want my stats here is the link to my epic spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M59TKDfW6cOLsUXsI_LvhMf2MDa51tJdzzQUZStnErg/edit?usp=sharing

989,8a1fkl,False,None,108,"Fuck my 1600; or, why I wish my parents had made learn the violin.",ApplyingToCollege,"Around this time, most of you have probably gotten your results back. Some of you are disappointed. Some of you are pleasantly surprised. And a very small, elite bunch of you are absolutely over the moon. But let's stop talking about you and start talking about someone I know much better.

Me.

Not too long ago, I fit into that third category. Yup, a perfect 1600. I don't know everything there is to know about this godforsaken test. Lord knows I practically guessed between the best two responses on a couple reading questions. And I actually made a mistake in the writing (blessed be thy curve). Hell, I did awful on the essay: a 6/3/5.

But hey, I got a 1600!

And I'll tell you a little secret... You know how when you're in the shower, fantasizing about whatever little thing, and you start playing that scene in your head, of hitting f5 on your keyboard, seeing that stupid acorn cb logo pop up, and then seeing the number in front of your eyes...

...It's fucking amaaaazing. Probably the single happiest moment of my life, pathetic as that might sound. Texting your friends, calling your family. Hearing your mom in the other room calling her friends saying ""Oh, the SAT? Oh, he did well. Very well, he actually got a perfect score. No, really. Yeah, a 1600."" As much as I had hyped myself up for that, it still exceeded my expectations.

Of course, that's nothing but a honeymoon period, and I was well aware of it. Life goes on, there's chem exams to worry about, and before you know it, you almost forget. But, there is one thing that sticks.

The ego.

But not any kind of ego. It's the feeling of confidence.

You see that kid over there? He plays basketball. Well. Meanwhile, I can't even do five push-ups without being sore for a week.

But, hey.

You got a 1600. He didn't.

Is it pathetic? Yeah. But it really, really helps. It's not that I lack confidence. It's not even that I'm insecure. It's just that I'm a narcissistic piece of shit. And hearing that voice inside my head is rather soothing.

Flash forward only a few weeks. I decide I should take the AMC 12, despite barely knowing it exists until some two weeks before the test day. Alright, I tell myself, Of course, this is a hard test. But I'm a fucking god at math, aren't I? Of course I am. Math is the one thing I'm better at than anything else. I'm the best person I know at math. I need to be in the top 5%. Small fry! I was in the top 0.03% for the SAT, and that's half reading, which I'm nowhere near as good at.

I got an 82.5. Respectable score, of course. But not even close to AIME qualifying. My mom told me I shouldn't think twice about it- Anyone doing well on this test studied for it for months, like I did for the SAT. I only did for a couple weeks. But still, I felt insulted. I'm BioticAsari-fucking-Babe. I fucking drink math for brunch, bitch! How the hell did I stare at a geometry problem for 15 minutes and come up with no good ideas for how to solve it? Am I dumb? Am I just not meant for math? I hope to god not. If I can't do math well, I can't think of anything that I can do any better. The notion of someone out there being better than me at Math drives me up the wall.

I move on.

Last week I went to a chamber concert. It was a piano quartet by Brahms, followed by a piano quartet by Walton. The Brahms left something to be desired- the violin was a tad loud, and the piano was a tad quiet. The Walton, though, was beautiful. It had this grand sense of theme and space. Gorgeously played. I can't help but think to myself- I'll never play like that. Sure, by the time I'm their age, I might play half-decent. But I won't be a virtuoso. Chances are, I'll never be a virtuoso.

Yesterday I was watching a video by this chess guy. It was about this 13-year old German kid who beat several grandmasters to win the Grenke open. Damn. I hear him again. I won't be that good when I'm 70.

I've been feeling two feelings lately, that I don't think I had ever felt before. The first is envy.

I had felt material envy. I had felt envy for my friends for all having phones when I didn't own one until I turned 17. I had felt envy for my friends for having driver's licenses when I don't because my parents can't afford the insurance. But this was a different kind of envy. A personal envy.

I didn't envy these people for what they had. I envied these people for what they could do.

What a bizarre feeling that is.

I envied the violist because she could play the viola. I want to play the viola. I envied the cellist, because he could play the cello. I want to play the cello. I envied the pianist, because he could play the piano. I can play the piano. But not very well. And I lack the time or money to truly pursue it to the point of playing even as a pro-am. I envied the chess kid, for playing chess like a god at his age. To my comfort, I'm sure many envy him. Even chess grandmasters, who know they weren't as good as him when they were his age, and he'll be much better than they are when he's their age. But I still envy him. And I still envy those kids that got into the AIME.

I'd like to comfort myself by saying it isn't fair. That they're somehow better off. But that's not true. They just spent more time practicing than I did. I would know- that's how I got a 1600 on the SAT.

The second feeling is contempt.

It isn't contempt for my father, for working upwards of 60 hours a week, practically breaking his back, all for what amounts to little more than peanuts- and all just out of his unending love for his family, which I am eternally grateful for. It isn't contempt for my mom, for being the best mother she could despite being in effectively 24/7 pain the last 8 years due to medical issues. It's not contempt for my grandfather, who was an awful father to mine (and a marginally better grandfather, at that.) It isn't even contempt for my uncle, who's got a million or two sitting on the dow, and who hasn't once offered to, say, I don't know, take me through Italy wine tasting.

I'ts contempt for me.

But not the me of now.

The me of later.

Why? Because I feel like a slave to him. Of course I will never be a piano virtuoso. But he might. So it is for him that I learn the piano. Of course I'm not smart enough to qualify for the AIME. But he might. So I buy 50 dollars worth of AoPS books, and study them on end.

But why must I do everything for him?

I've never even met the guy!

For all I know, he's an ass. Maybe he looks down on me not with pride but with shame. To think, that I was ever such an ungrateful child.

Why can't I make a hundred grand?! Not him, the me of ""the future.""

But me! I want my Wikipedia article, dammit. I want to be good at things! I want to write the Beethoven's 9th of the 21st century- BioticAsariBabe's 1st. I want to find the non-trivial zero to the Rieman-Zeta function with an imaginary component other than 1/2.

And I remind myself that he might. Maybe he will do all these things and more. But god, this whole process has made me hate him. I got a 1600 so that he can get into Stanford. I spend an hour at my shitty 90-dollar keyboard so that he might one day play the Emperor Concerto.

The men and women who have effected change or beauty (or disaster, even) in the human civilization did not do it by getting a perfect score on a standardized exam. Why can't I be them? Not him. ME!

Fuck my 1600.

I would gladly toss it to the curb if it meant I could truly do something well.

Edit: before someone mentions it: no, this is not an Asian parenting thing. Both my parents are extremely proud of me and have expressed that if anything, I should go a little easier on myself.

993,ehh80p,False,None,40,"As app season winds down, I'm realizing we might've made college a much bigger deal than it really should be",ApplyingToCollege,"I grew up with Asian parents who always daydreamed about me going to a prestigious college; my mom would often tell me how she hoped she'd be able to one day buy merch saying ""UC Berkeley Mom,"" etc. From a young age, I was given this idea that college was my ultimate end goal after 18 years and that my focus should be on maintaining perfect grades and academics in order to get into a good school. And at the start of high school, I legitimately thought I wouldn't even make it to my local community college, because my parents had instilled this idea in me that college was an impossibly lofty goal; I guess it was their (unhealthy) way of ""motivating"" me.

But as I progressed through HS, I started to realize that there are so, SO many options for after high school; there are so many colleges and universities out there with good programs that lead to promising career prospects and futures. Just because a school isn't top 10 on US News doesn't mean you can't be insanely successful upon graduating from there.

Having a dream school is great, but being rejected isn't even close to the end of the world. I guess as I worked through my apps this year, I started realizing that for some of us, we've placed all this emphasis on being the perfect candidate for admissions - taking a ton of AP and honors classes, joining a bunch of extracurriculars, taking on more than we can handle at times, sacrificing sleep, social life, and sometimes our sanity just to maintain grades, etc. There's a lot of competition and peer pressure too: comparing stats, number of AP classes, amount of extracurricular involvements...but here's a hot take: maybe that wasn't all that necessary. So what if you don't get into a school that's seen as ""prestigious"" based on some arbitrary ranking? Prestige isn't everything; and honestly, the quality of the programs at different schools isn't all that drastic. Plus, if you really think about it, college is only the next 4 years of your life. Think about how quickly the 4 years of HS flew by; it'll only feel faster in college. My point is, college is really just a fleetingly short part of your future, and afterwards, what really matters is what you make of and do with what you learned from your college experience.

When I was in the midst of it, it seemed totally reasonable to stress myself out over my grades, stats, essays, extracurriculars, and on and on, but stepping back a little bit and looking through a different perspective, you start to see that this all is just a tiny piece of your future. Whether you go to Harvard or your state school or community college, you're making efforts to better yourself through education. And that is a respectable commitment that you should be proud of. Plus, the vast majority of people don't go to these so-called T20 or T50 or even T100 schools and they are doing just fine in life. **I feel as if we've put certain schools and the high stats/impressive resume that comes with those on a pedestal, but that's really not an accurate portrayal of reality at all.** Stop beating yourself up over not having a 1500+ SAT or a 4.0 GPA. In the long run, this all doesn't matter as much as it can seem right now. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk :)
