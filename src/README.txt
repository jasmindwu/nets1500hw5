Title: Payoff Matrices Explorer

Description: This is an application that allows the user to input the values of payoff matrices
and explore the effects of the different values on Nash Equilibrium and best responses.
The user can either work with a 2x2 or 3x3 payoff matrix, and our program will let the user know
what the pure strategy Nash Equilibria are, if they exist, along with calculating
the p and q values for a mixed-strategy Nash Equilibrium. Also, the user can input the player
and move they want to know the best response for, and we will interpret the payoff
matrices in the context of social relations for 2x2 matrices. Players can choose to help
the other player or harm the other player, and we will model the situation with a graph,
creating a directed edge if a player chooses to help the other, and no edge otherwise--
users can explore connectivity and the graph created from different payoff values to study
the motivation behind helping/hurting and altruism.
